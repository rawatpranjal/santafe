We consider a synchronized double auction market populated by $N$ agents, indexed by $i \in \{1, \dots, N\}$. The market operates in discrete time steps $t = 1, \dots, T$ within a trading period. Each agent is endowed with a set of tokens, where buyers have private redemption values $v_{i,k}$ for the $k$-th unit, and sellers have private costs $c_{j,k}$.

The market state at time $t$ is defined by the limit order book, consisting of a set of outstanding bids $B_t = \{b_1, b_2, \dots\}$ and asks $A_t = \{a_1, a_2, \dots\}$. We denote the best (highest) bid as $b^*_t = \max B_t$ and the best (lowest) ask as $a^*_t = \min A_t$. The bid-ask spread is defined as $s_t = a^*_t - b^*_t$.

Following the specific rules of the Santa Fe Tournament \cite{rust1994}, the market proceeds in a synchronized two-phase step. In the Signaling Phase, all agents simultaneously observe the current book $(b^*_t, a^*_t)$ and may submit a new limit order. A buyer $i$ may submit a bid $b_{i,t} > b^*_t$ (improving the best bid) or $b_{i,t} = b^*_t$ (matching). Similarly, a seller $j$ may submit an ask $a_{j,t} < a^*_t$ or $a_{j,t} = a^*_t$. In the Clearing Phase, if the new orders cross (i.e., $b_{i,t} \ge a_{j,t}$), a transaction occurs immediately. The transaction price $p_t$ is determined by the standing order rule. In the Taking Phase, if no crossing occurs, agents are given a second opportunity to ``take'' the liquidity currently on the book. A buyer may accept $a^*_t$, or a seller may accept $b^*_t$.

\subsection{Experimental Environments}

Each experimental environment is a complete specification of market parameters. The number of buyers and sellers (up to 20 each) determines market structure. Each trader receives up to 4 tokens per period, with private values generated according to a gametype parameter that encodes four uniform random variable ranges using a base-3 coding scheme. The duration parameters specify rounds (up to 20), periods per round (up to 5), and time steps per period (up to 400). All programs receive common knowledge of these settings except gametype, which remains private.

Figure~\ref{fig:token_distribution} illustrates the token assignment structure. Buyer valuations decrease for successive units (reflecting diminishing marginal utility), while seller costs increase (reflecting increasing marginal cost). This structure generates downward-sloping demand and upward-sloping supply curves that intersect to determine the competitive equilibrium. Critically, these private values impose a budget constraint on rational agents: a buyer should never bid above their valuation, and a seller should never ask below their cost. As we demonstrate in subsequent sections, this constraint alone explains much of market efficiency, since it prevents trades that would destroy value.

Table~\ref{tab:environments} presents the ten canonical environments from the 1993 Santa Fe Tournament. These configurations systematically vary market structure, time pressure, and token endowments to stress-test trading algorithms across diverse conditions.
