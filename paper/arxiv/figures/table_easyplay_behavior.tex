\caption{Behavioral signatures in easy-play markets (1 buyer vs 7 TruthTeller sellers). Dominant Action shows the most frequent action type. PASS\% measures inactivity. SR (Spread Responsiveness) indicates strategic timing: negative values mean more activity when spreads are tight. PIR (Price Improvement Rate) measures how often quotes cross the spread. Profit/Trade measures extraction efficiency per executed trade.}
