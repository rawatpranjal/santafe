\begin{abstract}
In 1993, the Santa Fe Institute hosted a seminal tournament where simple "sniping" heuristics outperformed complex trading algorithms in a continuous double auction. Thirty years later, we revisit this environment to investigate whether modern Deep Reinforcement Learning (PPO) and Large Language Models (GPT-4o) can solve the information aggregation problem without hard-coded rules. We faithfully replicate the original synchronized double auction mechanism and introduce a new generation of agents. Our results show that: (1) PPO agents autonomously rediscover the "sniping" strategy, exploiting legacy heuristics; (2) Multi-agent PPO markets maintain high allocative efficiency, avoiding the market collapse observed in heuristic self-play; and (3) Zero-shot LLMs exhibit high efficiency but display distinct behavioral biases, prioritizing fairness over profit maximization. These findings suggest that while gradient-based learning can master market timing, semantic reasoning introduces a new, potentially stabilizing, dynamic to automated markets.
