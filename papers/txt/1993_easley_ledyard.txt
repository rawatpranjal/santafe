One of the major justifications for the study of equilibrium situations
in economics is the argument that there are forces at work in any economy
that tend to drive the economy toward an equilibrium if it is not in equilibrium
already. Although the concept of economic equilibrium has proven useful in
many situations, attempts to model and explain the forces that drive an economy
to equilibrium have met with little success. Most of the literature on -
stability of equilibrium uses the fiction of an auctioneer who adjusts a single,
known price for each good in response to stated excess demand resulting from
agents' equilibrium plans. The limitations and defects of this approach are
well known; for a survey of the literature see Arrow and Hahn [1971].

The recent work on experimental auction markets provides an opportunity
to examine the question of price formation and exchange in a new light. These
experiments simulate the auction-trading process characterstic of organized
commodity or stock exchanges. In these experiments prices and quantities
exchanged typically converge to at or near their competitive equilibrium
values. However, the experiments are characterized by a small number of
traders, with imperfect information, who determine prices through interactive
behavior rather than taking them as given. As a result, although the supply
and demand model of perfect competition yields reasonably correct predictions
of long-run average prices and quantities, it cannot yield any insights into
the process by which these prices are obtained.

This paper attempts to explain the price fonnation and exchange process
of experimental auction markets. We view the explanation of this process as
a first step toward understanding equilibrium price and quantity formation

in real markets.
-2-
SECTION I: THE EXPERIMENT

In an auction experiment a pool of subjects (usually 8 to 12) is
divided at random into a proup of buyers and a group of sellers, The buyers
are given payoff schedules telling them the amount in dollars that they will
receive, from the experimenter, for each unit of the good that they purchase.
' The sellers are given cost schedules telling them their cost in dollars for
each unit of the good they sell. Sellers keep the difference between their
selling price and cost on each unit sold. These payoff and cost schedules
induce demand and supply curves for the good; see Smith [1976] for a
complete explanation of induced demand and supply curves. Each trader knows
his own payoff schedule but is given no information about others' payoffs or
about the induced demand and supply curves.

After they receive their payoff information subjects are allowed to
trade during a market period of some fixed length. Buyers can make bids
(which become public information) to buy a unit of the good and sellers can
make offers (which also become public information) to sell a wit. If a bid
or offer is accepted a binding trade occurs and all traders are informed of
the contract price. Once a trade has been completed, bids and offers can
be made for another unit of the good. No information other than bids, offers,
acceptances, and contract prices is transmitted.

Once a market period ends the subjects are given new payoff schedules,
identical to their schedules for the previous period, and the experiment is
repeated. Market demand and supply conditions are typically held constant
across periods so that any equilibrating process that exists has a chance to
establish an equilibrium. After a small number of repetitions, prices and
quantities are close to the competitive equilibrium values for the demand and
supply curves induced by the subjects' payoffs. For a more detailed expiana-

tion of auction experiments and the usual results see Smith and Williams [1980]
-3-

These experiments provide a unique opportunity to examine price formation
for two reasons. The first is that unlike real-world markets, actual equilibrium
values for prices and quantities are known for the experimental markets. Second,
complete data on bids, offers, and contracts is available.

In order to examine the price formation process we will construct two
alternative models of the experiments. Each model yields the principal
observable experimental result - that contract prices converge to the competitive
equilibrium price. The essential difference between the models is in the
degree of aggregation. The first model is an aggregate model of the trading
process and it contains no explicit theory of individual behavior. The second
model provides a description of individual behavior and deduces convergence
from the assumed behavior. The assumptions on behavior may be thought of as
the result of prior learning about how to behave in the experiment. This
model predicts convergence and places strict bounds on the time path of prices
and quantities traded prior to convergence. Since this model places stringent
bounds on individual behavior its predictions are more often violated by
actual trades than are the predictions of the aggregate model. However, the
number of violations is amazingly small and the model seems to do a good job

of explaining how prices get adjusted.
SECTION II: DEFINITIONS AND MODEL I

The payoffs or values given to the buyers are ranked as vi > v" > vee > Vi >0
where yi is the i-th highest value and there are n units. The costs given to
sellers are ranked as 0 < ut < wt <u... < M" where MJ is the cost of the j-th
unit and there are m units. If a buyer or seller has payoffs for a mumber of
different units we will assume that he decides on strategies for each of them
separately. Prices, bids, offers, and contracts are in integer units in the

interval [0,P] (where P < » is some arbitrarily selected upperbound above yi

and M") and are indexed by P, b, o and c respectively.
-4-

Market periods or days for an experiment are indexed by de {1,2,...}.
The time remaining in any given day is indexed by t « {0,1,...,T}. In
order to insure that an experiment gets started we assume that the highest
value, vi, is greater than the lowest cost, Me

Model 1 will be an aggregate model in which trading occurs between
randomly slected agents. We assume that the prices at which these trades

occur in day d+l are influenced by prices, bids and offers observed in day d.

To this end we first present

Definition: Let ct be the set of observed contract prices in day d.

d

Let b” be the set of observed bids in d, and let of be the set of observed

offers in d.

Gi) ptt! = an tc4,0%s, where
co = g, b° = (03, 0° = (F} and » > P > max qvi My,
iii) st = potlpter.

Although it is unnecessary for the theory, one can view sf as the
assumed support of buyers' and sellers' expectations about prices in
day d+ 1. With these expectations, at least early in day d + 1, buyers
would be unwilling to pay more than pt and sellers would be unwilling to sell

for less than pt Hence we are interested in the collection of buyers and

sellers who can trade in st at any time t.

Definition: Let ree) = {(i,j): pt < vi < wd < po and i and j ure
not traded by t}. Let N(t) be the cardinality of ret).
R’{t) is the collection of buyers and sellers who can trude in
[P, al at time t (subject to the restriction imposed in the experiment that

< Vi and ct > M, i.e. no one can make a trade that results in a loss).

io]
1A

We shall assume that T > N(T); that is, there are enough time periods to enable
-5-

all feasible trades in [pt ty to be made. In Model 1 we assume that trade
takes place randomly among the buyers and sellers of R(t).

qd pty

re RCT) #4, select x, © (T, NCD], G*, 37) © RCD and py ©
such that vd <P eV The time, pair and price are selected randomly
from the sets of feasible times, pairs and prices according to probability
distributions on these feasible sets. The only assumption that we make on
these probabilities is that each point in the sets of feasible times, pairs
and prices has positive probability. We assume that a trade occurs at Ty»
between i and i, and at price Py . Further, we assume that for all t > 1,,
pt (t) < Py and ot (t) > Pt . Hence some buyers and sellers who can trade at
a price in st do so and by the time of their trade bids have not risen above
the contract price and offers have not fallen below it. Hence, either i has
made the maximum bid of pf (t4) = Py and ; accepts or ; has made the minimum
offer of ot (1) = Pm and i” accepts y's offer.

The next trade occurs at some randomly selected feasible price and
involves a randomly selected pair of buyers and sellers in Rt (rt). Tf

each feasible time, pair and price. A trade occurs at ty, between i: and
3° and at price P . Further, for all t ¢ (ty tol, ptr) < D> and
of (t) > Py . This process of random trading continues until there are no
more buyers and sellers who can trade in gh i.e. until t where ne (1) = 6.

Finally, we assume that any buyer (seller) who is left without having
traded by the time where po (1) = ¢ will eventually raise his bid above ad
it vi > B¢ Gower his offer below pd itw < pd, Formally, let tbe the
first time at which pi (t) = ¢, then if there is an untraded i such that

make a symmetric assumption on sellers. Essentially we are assuming that any
-6-

trader who has been unable to camplete a trade in st will eventually be
willing to trade outside of st if he can make a profit by doing so.

This model of the trading process has a number of relatively weak
implications for the data generated by market experiments. Let p° and q°
be respectively the competitive equilibrium price and quantity for the induced
demand and supply curves. We assume that there are traders with values at
p° and that the number of buyers with yi = p° is equal to the number of sellers
with ww = p: Under this assumption whenever all contracts take place at
p we have demand equal to supply. For experiments in which this assumption
is satisfied, Model I has four principal implications:

1. If p° E st at least q° units are traded in day d+ i,

2. If p® > pt (p® < pty then in day d + 1 there is an offer or

contract price below pd (bid or contract price above pty,
3. The time of trade h, th is in (tp N (yy) for each trade h.
4, With probability one there is a finite time at which st stabilizes

at exactly p.

Theorem 1 provides formal statement of implication 4.

All proofs will be presented in the Appendix.
Although this model yields the principal observable result of convergence

it provides little explanation of why convergence occurs. In order to explain

how prices are adjusted we need to construct a model of individual behavior.
-7-
SECTION III: MODEL IT

A subject in an auction has a complex decision problem: he must decide
when to bid, how much to bid, and whether or not to accept the trades
offered by other subjects. Further, all of these decisions must be made
with very imperfect information. The subject does not know the payoffs or
strategies of other agents and he does not know the terms of trade that will
be available to him in the future. Formally this structure defines a very
complex incomplete information game in which the individual mist choose bidding
and acceptance strategies. We will not attempt to model or solve the individual
optimization problem; instead we directly make assumptions about individual
behavior. The criteria that we use for the model are; first, that it be
reasonably consistent with optimal behavior but simple enough to allow a wide
range of "rule of thumb" strategies; second, that it be general enough to
allow differing expectations and learning behavior; third, that it be reasonably
consistent with the data.

We break the individual decision problem down into three elements. First,
the individual is assumed to have expectations about his trading opportunities
which are based on the contracts, bids and offers that he observed last period.
Second, the individual is assumed to have a reservation price strategy which
for a buyer gives the maximum offer price that he will accept. Third,
individuals are assumed to have bidding strategies which for a buyer gives
the maximm bid that the buyer would like to enter.

The reservation price and bidding strategies are obviously dependent on
the individuals' expectations and will be adjusted over time based on how
successful they are. Any buyer who observes that he has paid the highest
price in a market period should learn to reduce both his reservation price

and his bids. Similarly any buyer who was unable to make a purchase, i.e.
-8-

was rationed-out, should raise his reservation price if possible. Sellers
should behave symmetrically in adjusting to having sold for the lowest price
or having been rationed-out of the market. Rather than formally describing
the learning process outlined above we will describe reservation price

and bidding strategies that could be the outcome of such a learning process.
The following assumption specifies the key unobserved primitives of our

theory of individual behavior.

Assumption 0: For each untradedunit of a buyer (i = 1,...,n) or seller
(j = 1,...,m) there is an (unobservable) reservation price at each d and t which
is denoted by v(t) e RE for buyers and w) (t) ¢ R! for sellers.

We next formiulate two assumptions which specify bidding behavior

given reservation prices and reservation price behavior given observable data.

Assumption 1: Bidding and Contracts
(i) ptt) , the current outstanding bid in day d with time t left,
is held by a buyer i* where vi (t) > vat) , for all untraded
ie=1,...,n.

Gi) bo ¢r)

(iii) v4 (t) vito), for all i # i* with i untraded.

iv

(iv) i* accepts the current outstanding offer, 0% (t) , if and only if
i*
o* (+) < Va (t). No other i accepts oft), (Notice that i* is a

function of d and t.)

This assumption is really the reduced form of an assumption that_auctions

behave as English auctions and that action occurs sufficiently smoothly so that

"surprises"! don't occur. In particular, we are assuming that if buyer i is
willing to pay vi(t) , and the outstanding bid b(t) is less than that and is
not held by i, then i should offer a higher bid. Any buyer who does not do
so takes a chance of being rationed out even though. he is willing to pay more

than the current high bid. Hence bids should quickly rise to MAX twit}
i #i*
-9-

and i* should hold the highest bid. We further assume that only this highest
bid is accepted. Since i* has the highest reservation price he will be the
only buyer to accept an offer provided that offers fall smoothly. That is
if the offers start above va (0) and do not jump down to war (v4(t)} or
L

less then only i* can accept an offer.

If reservation prices change smoothly over time, parts (iii) and (iv)
of Assumption 1 are not likely to be violated at any time other than the
beginning of a market day. Att =T it is possible to have a number of buyers
with reservation prices above the reservation prices of some sellers. In this
case, even if bids follow the pattern of Assumption 1, trading need not be
between the highest reservation price buyer and the lowest reservation price
seller. However, such overlap of reservation prices can occur only at the
beginning of the market day and any perverse trading that results will not
_ affect convergence if only infra-marginal units trade.
We make assumptions on the reservation price and bids of sellers that

are symmetric with those made for buyers. The inequalities are reversed in

the obvious way.

Assumption 1': Offers and Contracts
(i) of(t), the current outstanding offer in day d with time t left,
is held by a seller j* where w(t) < w(t), for all j =1,...,m,
for all untraded j.

(i) f(t) > wi"(e).

Wv

(iii) 0% Ce) < wh(t), for all j # j*, j untraded.

LA

sk
(iv) j* accepts vot) if and only if b(t) > WA (t). No other j

accepts ot(t).

The assumptions made to this point in Model II place no restrictions on

the data since for any observed sequence of bids, offers, and acceptances, one
-10-

can construct reservation prices consistent with Assumption 1 and those observa-
tions. Therefore, in order to have a theory, we must connect the reservation
prices to the observable data for each i andj. This link is made in

Assumption 2.

Assumption 2: Reservation Price Formation

Assumption 2 (i) is that no buyer can be willing to pay more than the true
value for any unit. Assumption 2 (ii) (a)would be a natural result of having
expectations with a support of st¢t). Part 2 (ii) (b) requires the buyer to
not be willing to pay pt or more too early in the day (i.e., for t > th,

-11-

price next time. If there is a buyer who has vite) > ad and who does not learn,
he may continually pay the highest price and hence prevent convergence
to the competitive equilibrium.

Assumption 2 (iii) is a minimal assumption on the relationhip of reserva-
tion prices to true values. If ys < ws then k* is larger than the competi-
tive equilibrium quantity, or what is more important for our purposes, the
maximum quantity that can be transacted at any single price. The assumption
is that buyers with values above ys and above p4 have higher reservation prices
than those with values at or below ve provided that ical > 1, Any such
buyer who does not have vy Ct) high enough to keep the potential extra marginal
buyers (those with yi < yy out of the market may either be rationed out of
the market or be forced to pay a high price at the end of the day in order to
trade with an extra marginal seller. Such a buyer should leam to raise his
reservation price for the early part of the market day. Any buyer who does
not do so will either frequently be rationed and hence frequently move the
market away from Dp or will end up paying a price above pd at the end of the
period and hence keep the upper limit of the contract prices from falling to
the competitive equilibriun.

Part (ii) (c-e) is a sequence of assumptions requiring that the buyers
eventually cave in to pa and above but that they not cave in too quickly.

Part (c} requires that for some tt > | buyer i must cave in to pa - 1, if
possible, provided that he has not yet traded. Presumably a buyer holds out

for a low price early in the day but eventually he should be willing to pay
higher and higher prices as the end of the day approaches. This characteristic
will result from a finite horizon search problem. Parts (d) and (e) require
that near the end of the day buyers who see their bids of pe - lor pt
rejected mist increase their reservation prices if it is possible for them
to do so. Buyers who do not learn to do so may end up being continually

rationed out and not signalling to the market that the prices are too low.
-12-

If this happens prices can get stuck below the competitive equilibrium. Buyers
who cave in too soon, that is, raise va(t) before a bid is rejected may end
up paying an unnecessarily high price and should learn to reduce their
reservation prices. Again if such buyers do not learn then pe can get stuck
above the competitive equilibriun.

We make a symmetric assumption for sellers and call that Assumption 2'.
Whether the assumptions of Model II on individual behavior are consistent
with rational maximizing behavior or not is an open question. We believe
that these assumptions result in a reasonable description of the actual
behavior that occurs in the experimental markets that we have examined. In
Section V a number of testable implications that result from this model of
behavior are confronted with data from a group of nine market experiments.

Figure 1 illustrates a set of time paths for reservation prices, bids
and offers that is consistent with our assumptions. In this example buyer 1
and seller 2 contract the first unit at ty since 1's acceptance price is
exceeded by 2's offer at this time. At to, seller 1 accepts buyer 2's bid
and at t, buyer 3 accepts seller 4's offer. Note that buyer 4 and seller 3
may not trade since there are no competitive pressures driving their bids and
offers together.

Figure 2 illustrates the observable data from figure 1. This type of

pattern is consistent with the data in experiments.

SECTION IV: THEOREMS FOR MODEL IT

In this section we trace through some of the implications of Model If.
As will become apparent, most of the action will occur when there is an
"excess demand or supply'"' of two or more units remaining in the auction since
in this case there are competitive pressures on bids and offers. Thus we are

interested in the following concept.

befinition: Let D(P) = # (vi > P} and S(P) = # ( <P}. We let

ty

p* = inf (P|S(P) - D(P) > 2} and P, = sup {P|D(P) - S(P) > 2}.

*
To see the role of P and P, we consider the following propositions.

Lemma 1: For Model If:

(a) re B < p, then et » 4,
k
(b) rf pt > Pp then pet? < pt,
Lemma 2: For Model IT:
(a) If pd > P, then perl > Py
* *
(b) If pt < P then perl <P,

Thus there are competitive forces driving the maximum contract prices
above P, and the minimm contract prices below P There are also competi-
tive pressures driving the maximum prices down and the minimum prices up.
These pressures are exerted by extra-marginal units as can be seen in the

following propositions.

Lemma 3: In Model II, suppose pt pt >:

that "prices converge to an equilibrium" we must consider what occurs when

Py < pa < we Unfortunately, under the assumed behavior of Model II, it is
possible for prices to bounce around inside this interval and, in some cases,

to bounce outside. The case where this won't happen is described in the next

occurs for all demand-supply configurations, However, we can say something
for most configurations and, in particular, for those which have been used

in the experiments reported in the next section.

assured (although possible) when either Pp > wk or yi > P,. The following

configuration is consistent with this situation.

SECTION V: COMPARISON OF PREDICTIONS WITH THE DATA

The prediction of convergence, which results from both models, is not
testable since the mmber of necessary replications a” may. be large. Hence
in order to compare the models with the data it is necessary to describe
the potential dynamics implied by the theories. There are four categories
of data for which one or both of the theories have implications: the
sequence of contract prices, the sequence of trading partners, the total
quantity traded, and the behavior of untraded units at the end of the day.

‘We will carry out the analysis of the dynamics for Model I under an assumption
that # tiv = p'} = # {4:M . pd # 0. This assumption is satisfied in all
but one of the experiments for which we have data. In terms of the variables
used to discuss convergence for Model II a similar assumption is
us > P > Py > v_ tis assumption is implied by the assumption to be used
for Model I, but they are not equivalent. There is one experiment (PDA 22)
in which this condition is satisfied but the condition used for Model I is
violated. For all of the other experiments for which we have data both
conditions are satisfied and hence violation of the predictions of the

alternative models are directly comparable.

MODEL I:
The implications from Model I can be represented in two cases.
Case 1: P° <p
(a) First, qt = (BY contracts occur at all prices cf eS.
{b} Second, after the da contracts there is a bid above pt

(b). There are no implications for bids or offers after the q trades.
-17-

The implications for vd are symmetric. Model I has implications for prices,
quantities, and the final bids (or offers) if pt < rn” (if pt > P); but it

has no implications on the sequence of trading.

MODEL IT:
Model II has much more precise implications than does Model I. The
implications of Model II for prices, total quantity, and the sequence of

trading can be represented in three cases.

The analysis of each case follows from the earlier lemmas. Case 1 comes
from lemma 1, Case 2 from lemma 3 and Case 3 from lemmas 2 and 4. Symmetric
results hold for pt

Model II also has more precise implications for final bids and offers.

Although resérvation prices are unobservable; A.2(ii) does imply that,
near the end of each day, reservation prices of untraded units should be
equal to true values if those values are less than pt for buyers or greater

than pt for sellers. Thus, in strict terms at t = 0 our theory implies

Implication (a) follows from the fact that vq (0) = Vt and A.1 on bidding.

then buyer (1) should accept at t = 1.

To put the dayend errors in context, there are two major violators.
In II PDAS7, seller 2 consistently held to a high reservation price on a
marginal unit and, in fact, lost money on this strategy. No other dayend
errors occured in II PDA57. Second, the experiment II PDAZS had a time queue
in which bids entered are accepted chronologically and leave the queue at
3-second intervals. This institution clearly destablizes bidding. If we
could ignore these two pathologies, the total percentage dayend errors for

Model II would be 7.5%.

SECTION VI: CONCLUSION

The two models presented here are deterministic and, although they do not
describe precise paths of bids, offers, and contracts, they do place fairly
tight bounds on these data. One observation not in accord with these bounds
is grounds for réjection of these theories and, in fact, there are a number
of such observations. However, the percentage of observations which violate
the crucial implications of the theories is, we feel, amazingly low. The
implications of Model I are violated less often than the implications of
Model II for two reasons. One is simply that Model I has weaker implications
for the time paths of prices and trades than does Model IT. Secondly,

Model I provides almost no explanation of which buyers and sellers trade so
it has no implications for the sequence of trading. Hence, although there
are more violations of the implications of Model II, we feel that it contains
a useful theory as it provides an explanation of how and why prices and
quantitiés adjust to their competitive equilibrium values.

The potential importance of this theory is not that it seems to describe
what happens in DOA experiments, but that it is the beginning of a theory of
how market prices are formed and of how they adjust to changes in demand and

supply conditions. The question of price formation has a long history of ad-
hoc and unsuccessful attempts at an answer. Qur theory is also ad-hoc in the
sense that we directly make assumptions on individual behavior which are not
derived from an optimizing model. However, our assumptions seem reasonably
consistent with rational behavior and more importantly they seem to do a

reasonable job of describing actual behavior.
APPENDIX: PROOFS

Proof of Theorem 1:

We first show: (1) If S = p° for all n=1,2,....

d*

First consider day d*+1, Since S$

where Rt +1.) = ¢ must occur at p- Now since S" = pr we have

of one buyer and one seller we must have # {i: (41,j) « pa *Tety

# {4: Gi,j) « Rf lee), for some i}, for any t, T >t > 0. Therefore if

Then by the signalling assumption of Model I no bids above p° or offers below

p will result. Therefore pd +1 MAX etl pitty = p°

Secondly, we show: (2) If p° e S then Prob {S = p} > 0. If

p° € st then it follows from the trading process assumption that exactly k
trades, all at price Pr’, and between buyers i = 1,2, ... , k and sellers

j = 1, 2, ...., k has positive probability. If this event occurs then no
further trades at any price other than p can result and there can be no bids

above p° or offers below p. Hence, if this event occurs gttl = p and we

have Prob pgdtl = pe} > 0 from the trading process assumption.

Finally, we show: (3) If p° ¢ gf then there exists a finite integer

d

d (indenendent of d) such that p° e S°, for some d <dt d. It is sufficient

to show that if pd < r- then pal > pe and similarly if pt > p° then

some i}. Hence, it follows from the assumption on the trading process that
-2-

there exists a t > 0 with Re (2) = » and since all trades are two sided there

is at least one buyer j with v2 > pt and i untraded. Then by the signalling

assumption there will be a bid above 54. Hence, piel . pt the argument for

pdt < pt if pt > p° is symmetric.

*
Now let d be the first d at which st = p’. We have p- € st infinitely

*
often by (3) and Prob rgd*l = p} > 0 if p € st by (2). Therefore, d is finite

with probability one. Then it follows from (1) that for alld>d, gtap®,
Proof of Lemma 1: We show (a); the proof of (b) is symmetric. If all contracts

are at pricess less than or equal to pd then there exist at least two V™ > sd

which are untraded. By A.2(ii) at some time before t = 0 there will be a bid

b greater than or equal to the second highest v(t) > pd

Proof of Lemma 2: We show (a); the proof of (b) is symmetric. If all contracts

are less than P, then there exist at least two untraded V* such that yt > Py.

Thus there will be a bid b > P, before t = 0.

Proof of Lemma 3: We show (a); the proof of (b) is symmetric. We will show
d

that whenever there is an untraded V" > B°, there will be an offer 0 < pd

which i can accept. Thus no contracts at prices > pd will be seen.

Suppose there are r untraded V’ with V’ > 64 since all vt > 64 ust

d

will be an offer 0 < ? which some Vt > P© will accept. If r = 0, then there

Proof of Lemma 4: We show (a}; the proof of (b). is symmetric. In order to

pd > yk and by A.2(iii), there were at most k - 2 contracts. Thus
. ‘k - .
there exist untraded M” < wi . Therefore there was an offer 0 < wk < Vv

which i would have accepted. Thus there was no such Vv.
Proof of Theorem 2:. The proof of Theorem 2 follows directly fram Lemmas 1

through 4 and the observation that there are a finite number of possible prices,

0, 1, ..., P.

Proof of Corollary 1: The proof of Corollary 1 follows directly from Theorem

and the observation that if P, = P then P, =P = Dp.
