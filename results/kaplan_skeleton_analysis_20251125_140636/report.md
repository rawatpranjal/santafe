## Executive Summary

This analysis investigates whether Kaplan's predatory sniping strategy benefits from the presence of Skeleton agents in mixed-strategy double auction tournaments.

### Key Findings


**Baseline Comparison (With vs Without Skeleton):**
- Mean profit WITHOUT Skeleton: 106.20
- Mean profit WITH Skeleton: 113.85
- Difference: 7.66 (7.2%)
- T-statistic: 7.325
- P-value: 0.0000
- Cohen's d: 0.096
- **Statistically Significant:** YES ✓


**ANOVA (Across all Skeleton densities):**
- F-statistic: 29.624
- P-value: 0.0000
- **Statistically Significant:** YES ✓


**Linear Regression (Profit ~ Skeleton %):**
- Slope: 0.2568 (profit change per 1% Skeleton increase)
- R²: 0.0046
- P-value: 0.0000
- **Statistically Significant:** YES ✓

## Methodology

**Tournament Structure:**
- 8 buyers × 8 sellers (16 total agents)
- 100 rounds × 10 periods = 1,000 market instances per configuration
- 100 steps per period
- Game 6453 token generation (Santa Fe standard)

**Treatments:**
- Control: 0% Skeleton (Kaplan vs ZIC/ZIP/GD only)
- Varying Skeleton density: 12.5%, 25%, 37.5%, 50%, 62.5%
- Kaplan held constant at 25% (2/8 agents) across all treatments

## Discussion

### Mechanism

Kaplan's sniping strategy exploits Skeleton's predictable alpha-weighted convergence:
1. Skeleton agents narrow the spread through adaptive weighted-average bidding
2. Kaplan waits at extreme prices (bid=1 or ask=999)
3. Kaplan snipes trades at favorable prices after spread narrows
4. Visual test evidence: Kaplan achieves 2.2x profit advantage in pure Kaplan vs Skeleton matchups

### Implications

**For Kaplan:**
- Skeleton presence increases exploitable patterns in the market
- Kaplan's timing-based advantage allows surplus extraction even in efficient markets

**For Market Design:**
- High efficiency does not guarantee equitable surplus distribution
- Patient strategic agents can dominate adaptive but predictable opponents

---

## Recommendations

1. **Against Kaplan:** Avoid predictable convergence patterns; use randomization or time-varying strategies
2. **With Kaplan:** Optimal opponent mix depends on analysis results (see metrics table above)
3. **For RL Training:** Use Kaplan as adversary to learn robust non-exploitable policies
