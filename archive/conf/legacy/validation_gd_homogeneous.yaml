# Validation experiment: Homogeneous GD market
# Expected: High efficiency convergence to competitive equilibrium
# Reference: Gjerstad & Dickhaut (1998), Section 6.2 - Homogeneous Markets
experiment:
  name: "validation_gd_homogeneous"
  num_rounds: 100
  description: "Test GD agent efficiency in homogeneous market (all GD)"

agents:
  buyer_types: ["GD", "GD", "GD", "GD", "GD"]
  seller_types: ["GD", "GD", "GD", "GD", "GD"]

# Expected outcomes (from literature):
# - Efficiency: 95%+ (GD agents should learn optimal beliefs and converge quickly)
# - Price convergence: Rapid convergence to competitive equilibrium price
# - Variance: Low price variance after initial learning period (~10-20 rounds)
# - Beliefs: p(a) and q(b) should stabilize around equilibrium acceptance probabilities
