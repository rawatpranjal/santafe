# @package _global_
# Test GD vs ZIC with tighter price range to reduce noise
#
# Hypothesis: Wide price range (1-1000) allows ZIC to pollute GD's beliefs
# with extreme random quotes. Tightening to (100-500) should improve efficiency.

# Expected: If belief pollution is the issue, efficiency should improve from 38% toward 85%+
