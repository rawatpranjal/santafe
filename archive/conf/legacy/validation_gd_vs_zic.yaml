# Validation experiment: GD vs ZIC comparison
# Expected: GD should achieve higher efficiency than ZIC due to belief-based learning
# Reference: Gjerstad & Dickhaut (1998), Section 6 - Experimental Results
experiment:
  name: "validation_gd_vs_zic"
  num_rounds: 100
  description: "Compare GD agent efficiency against ZIC baseline"

agents:
  buyer_types: ["GD", "GD", "GD", "ZIC", "ZIC"]
  seller_types: ["GD", "GD", "GD", "ZIC", "ZIC"]

# Expected outcomes (from literature):
# - GD vs GD: ~95%+ efficiency (near-competitive equilibrium)
# - GD vs ZIC: ~85-95% efficiency (GD should outperform ZIC)
# - ZIC vs ZIC: ~80-90% efficiency (baseline from Gode & Sunder 1993)
