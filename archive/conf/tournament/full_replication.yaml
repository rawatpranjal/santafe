# @package _global_
# Full Tournament Replication Suite
# Runs all 10 environments from the 1994 Santa Fe Tournament

experiment:
  name: "full_tournament_replication"
  description: "Complete replication of 1994 Santa Fe Tournament - all 10 environments"
  num_rounds: 100  # 100 rounds per environment for statistical significance

# This config references all 10 environment configs
# Use Hydra multirun to execute all environments:
# python scripts/run_tournament.py --multirun experiment=tournament/environments/base,tournament/environments/bbbs,tournament/environments/bsss,tournament/environments/eql,tournament/environments/ran,tournament/environments/per,tournament/environments/shrt,tournament/environments/tok,tournament/environments/sml,tournament/environments/lad

# Tournament-level configuration
tournament:
  environments:
    - "base"   # Standard competitive market
    - "bbbs"   # Duopoly (2 buyers, 4 sellers)
    - "bsss"   # Duopsony (4 buyers, 2 sellers)
    - "eql"    # Symmetric values
    - "ran"    # Independent random values
    - "per"    # Single period only
    - "shrt"   # High time pressure (20 steps)
    - "tok"    # Single token per trader
    - "sml"    # Small market (2x2)
    - "lad"    # Large asymmetric demand

  # Scoring and ranking
  scoring:
    method: "efficiency_ratio"  # Score = actual_profit / theoretical_max
    weight_equally: true  # Equal weight across all environments
    rank_by: "average"    # Rank by average score across environments

  # Expected outcomes (from 1994 paper)
  expected:
    overall_efficiency: 0.897  # 89.7%
    efficiency_tolerance: 0.05  # ±5%
    kaplan_mixed: 1.21  # 121% in heterogeneous markets
    kaplan_pure: 0.60   # <60% in homogeneous markets
    price_autocorr: -0.25  # Negative autocorrelation
    autocorr_tolerance: 0.05

  # Analysis outputs
  outputs:
    generate_table_4: true  # Compare to Rust et al. Table 4
    plot_dynamics: true
    save_raw_data: true
