Based on the deep engagement with the Santa Fe Tournament, the Gode and Sunder Hypothesis, Wilson's Equilibrium, and the general literature on algorithmic trading and market microstructure, here are the 10 most critical, literature-aligned research questions:

| \# | Research Question (Closest to Literature) | Literature Connection |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Is the Sniping Paradox Resolved by Gradient-Based Learning?** Does homogeneous PPO self-play avoid the "Kaplan Deadlock" (liquidity collapse) by discovering a mixed strategy of liquidity provision, or does it converge to stable but inefficient algorithmic collusion? | Rust et al. (1994), Wilson (1987). Focuses on the core tension between individual rationality and collective efficiency. |
| **2** | **Does PPO Intelligence Fundamentally Shift the Gode and Sunder Hypothesis?** Does the PPO agent's learning capability yield allocative efficiency gains significantly beyond those provided by the simple budget constraint (ZIC), proving that "super-rational" AI dominates structure? | Gode & Sunder (1993). Re-tests the foundational claim that structure, not intelligence, drives efficiency, using a modern, superior form of intelligence. |
| **3** | **What is the Rent-Seeking Premium of Superior AI?** How much greater is the individual profit share ($E_i$) of advanced agents (PPO, GPT-4o) when competing against legacy agents, quantifying the exploitative power of intelligence disparity? | Cliff & Bruten (1997), Chen & Tai (2010). Addresses the critical metric of equity and the market's failure to distribute surplus fairly when intelligence is uneven. |
| **4** | **What is the PPO Agent's Implicit Belief Function Signature?** Can the opaque PPO policy be mapped onto explicit economic theory, such as the Implicit Markup ($\hat{m}$) or the probability-of-acceptance belief function (Gjerstad & Dickhaut)? | Gjerstad & Dickhaut (1998), Zhan & Friedman (2007). Provides a novel interpretability framework to demystify DRL trading by linking it to established economic models of decision-making. |
| **5** | **Can Zero-Shot Semantic Reasoning Match Optimized Heuristics?** Does an LLM, relying solely on contextual interpretation of rules, achieve the profit ratios and efficiency of adaptive margin-based algorithms (ZIP) or sniping heuristics (Kaplan)? | Easley & Ledyard (1993), Friedman (1991). Benchmarks semantic understanding against decades of hand-crafted optimization efforts. |
| **6** | **How Does Intelligence Type Govern Market Timing (Procrastination)?** Do PPO agents replicate the strategic delay in bidding characteristic of sniping and the Walrasian waiting game, or does gradient descent favor more aggressive, liquidity-providing behavior? | Wilson (1987), Chen & Yu (2011). Focuses on the temporal dimension of strategy, a key differentiator in auction theory. |
| **7** | **Is Adaptive Margin Learning (ZIP) Robust Against Modern AI?** Given the demonstrated robustness and minimal hyperparameter sensitivity of ZIP, can this simple, learning-rate-driven heuristic still maintain competitive profitability when facing sophisticated PPO and LLM strategies? | Cliff & Bruten (1997). Tests the resilience of the most successful *adaptive* heuristic against new AI paradigms. |
| **8** | **How Do Asymmetric Environments Stress AI Agents?** In seller-dominated (BSSS) or high-pressure (SHRT) environments, which AI paradigm (PPO, LLM, or ZIP) demonstrates the greatest loss in efficiency or increase in volatility? | Rust et al. (1994) Tournament Configurations. Evaluates robustness across the canonical stress tests designed by the original Santa Fe researchers. |
| **9** | **Is Role Specialization Necessary for Autonomous Trading Agents?** Does the PPO agent's failure when generalizing from buyer to seller confirm that role-specific training is mandatory in the two-stage AURORA protocol, or can LLMs overcome this asymmetry semantically? | Market Microstructure/AURORA Rules. Focuses on the impact of specific institutional rules on agent design and policy generalization. |
| **10** | **What is the PPO Signature on Cross-Agent Profit Dispersion?** Does the PPO self-play market lead to low profit dispersion, suggesting equitable surplus allocation through fierce competition, or high dispersion, indicating a chaotic or less mature equilibrium? | Cliff & Bruten (1997). Profit dispersion is the primary metric for distinguishing truly intelligent traders from high-efficiency ZIC agents. |
