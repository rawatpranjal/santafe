- The key findings from the literature: 

- VMarkets Compute Equilibrium Using Only Private Information: Vernon Smith and subsequent researchers proved that markets converge to the theoretical competitive equilibrium even when traders have strictly private information (knowing only their own costs/values) and possess no knowledge of aggregate supply and demand. The market mechanism itself acts as a computer, aggregating dispersed information into a single price.

- The "Invisible Hand" Requires a Public Ticker: E.H. Chamberlin’s early experiments (1948) failed to converge to competitive equilibrium because traders roamed around the room bargaining privately. Vernon Smith (1962) succeeded where Chamberlin failed by introducing a centralized mechanism (a blackboard or "ticker") where bids and asks were publicly displayed. This qualitative shift proved that for the "Invisible Hand" to work, the bid/ask information must be public and common, not private and bilateral. There needs to be a minimum of public information anchoring the market, even while only traders themselves know about their private tokens. 

- Price Convergence Follows a Predictable Directional Path: Vernon Smith (and later confirmed by Cliff & Bruten) observed that markets do not converge randomly. In markets with excess supply, prices tend to start high and glide downward. In markets with excess demand, they start low and glide upward. This path dependence refutes the Walrasian Auctioneer model (which assumes prices are just "announced" at equilibrium) and highlights that the process of trading creates a price trajectory that reflects the underlying scarcity pressures of the specific environment.

- Market Structure Drives Efficiency, Not Trader Intelligence: Gode & Sunder famously demonstrated that "Zero-Intelligence" (ZI) traders—who bid randomly subject only to a budget constraint—can achieve near-perfect market efficiency. Gode & Sunder experimented with two types of ZI traders: those who could trade at any price (ZI-U), and those restricted from trading at a loss (ZI-C). The ZI-U markets were chaotic and inefficient. The ZI-C markets were highly efficient. This implies that the allocative efficiency of a market is primarily a property of the (the Double Auction mechanism) rather than the cognitive sophistication of the participants.

- Intelligence Ensures Equity; Structure Ensures Efficiency: While Gode & Sunder found that Zero-Intelligence traders could maximize the total surplus (allocative efficiency), they found that the profit dispersion (inequality) among ZI traders was massive. Some ZI traders got lucky and earned huge profits, while others earned barely anything. In contrast, human markets and "intelligent" agent markets show much lower profit dispersion. This suggests that while market structure ensures the market succeeds, individual intelligence is required to ensure the individual gets their "fair share" of the wealth defined by theory.

- Price Stability Requires Adaptive Learning, Not Just Randomness: Cliff & Bruten challenged Gode & Sunder by showing that while ZI traders get the efficiency right, they get the price dynamic wrong. ZI traders produce high price volatility and fail to "settle" at a price. To replicate the price stability and convergence paths seen in human markets, agents require at least minimal adaptive capability (simple machine learning or heuristics like "ZIP" traders).

- Rapid Convergence Requires Forming Beliefs About Acceptable Prices: Gjerstad & Dickhaut (1998) demonstrated that mere heuristics (like "shout a bit higher than last time") aren't enough to explain the speed and precision of human convergence. They found that effective traders form belief functions—subjective probabilities that a specific bid/ask will be accepted based on recent history. It is this updating of "acceptance probability," rather than raw price adjustment, that drives the rapid snapping-to-equilibrium seen in later experiments.

- Simple Heuristics Outperform Complex Mathematical Optimization: In the Santa Fe Double Auction Tournament (Rust et al.), the winning strategy (Kaplan) was one of the simplest codebases entered. It beat complex strategies that used neural networks, Bayesian updating, and heavy statistical analysis. The finding suggests that in noisy, game-theoretic environments, "bounded rationality" and simple heuristics are ecologically superior to deep calculation.

- The Dominant "Sniper" Strategy is Parasitic and Market-Destroying: The Santa Fe tournament discovered that the dominant strategy is to "wait in the background" and snipe a deal only when the bid-ask spread narrows. However, this strategy is parasitic—it relies on *other* (less intelligent) traders to reveal information and provide liquidity. If all traders adopt this "optimal" strategy, liquidity dries up, information is not revealed, and the market crashes (a "closing panic").

- Inefficient "Noise Traders" Are Essential for Market Liquidity: Following the finding above, Rust et al. found that for a market to function continuously, there must be a steady inflow of "noise traders" (impatient or random participants). These traders lose money, but they provide the necessary "lubrication" (information and liquidity) that allows the sophisticated traders to function and the market to clear.

- Aggressive, Inefficient Traders Can "Crowd Out" Efficient Ones: Rust, Palmer, & Miller decomposed efficiency losses and found that in Agent-Based markets, a significant portion of inefficiency comes from extra-marginal displacement. This occurs when an aggressive trader (who shouldn't be trading because their costs are too high) "steals" a trade from a more efficient trader. This qualitative finding shows that in dynamic markets, "bad" traders can actively crowd out "good" traders in the short run, a nuance often missed by static equilibrium theory.

- Market Equilibrium is an Endless Evolutionary Arms Race of Strategies: Chen & Tai showed that while human-written strategies (like Kaplan) might dominate initially, autonomous "Genetic Programming" agents eventually learn to defeat them. This suggests that market equilibrium is not just about price, but about an evolutionary equilibrium of strategies—as soon as one strategy dominates, it creates an incentive for a new strategy to evolve to exploit it.
