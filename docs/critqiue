-- We will use PPO not DQN, as the main RL algo
-- in abstract mention classical trading programs (ZIC, Kaplan, etc.) and do highlight them. 
3. The most papers that build the story for this paper are:
1) vernon smith's experiemnts that showed that the double auction has remarkable efficeicny in classroom experiments
2) the gode sunder result that DA is efficeint even with random traders (the market mechanism is powerful)
3) the Rust et al contest which shows that simple passive strategies like sniping can be very powerful and evolutionarily stable (with a small stream of active trading)
4) the Chen et al paper shows that genetic programming can beat all opponents with enough time

and our paper is placed here as 
5) a) RL can beat all opponents given enough time (or a simulator of the world), and b) multi agent RL equilibria is generally efficient c) more information is not necessarily good for market efficeincy (we will add experiments where we limit market participants informatino sets) 

-- remove stuff about regulator DQN
-- write in consice way (show dont tell). 
-- we will add appendixes for the double auction rules in more details (appendix A) trader algoirhthms (appendix B) and PPO (appendix C) so you ccan refer to them. 
-- the results for each will have two tables: (1) individual performacne, (2) market performacne.
