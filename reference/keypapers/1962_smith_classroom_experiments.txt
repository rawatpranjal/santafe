Each seller receives a card containing

a group of buyers and a group of sellers.
Each buyer receives a card containing

a number, known only to that seller,
which represents the minimum price at
which he is willing to relinquish one unit
of the commodity. It is explained that
the sellers should be willing to sell at
their minimum supply price rather than

a number, known only to that buyer,
which represents the maximum price he
is willing to pay for one unit of the
fictitious commodity. It is explained that

the buyers are not to buy a unit of the
commodity at a price exceeding that

appearing on their buyer's card; they
would be quite happy to purchase a
unit at any price below this number-the
lower the better; but, they would be

entirely willing to pay just this price
for the commodity rather than have their
wants go unsatisfied. It is further explained that each buyer should think

of himself as making a pure profit equal
to the difference between his actual contract price and the maximum reservation price on his card. These reservation
prices generate a demand curve such
as DD in the diagram on the left in

amount that could be purchased at that

fail to make a sale, but they make a

pure profit determined by the excess
of their contract price over their minimum reservation price. Under no con-

dition should they sell below this minimum. These minimum seller prices generate a supply curve such as SS in Chart
1. At each hypothetical price the corresponding quantity represents the maximum amount that could be sold at that
price. The supply curve, therefore, defines the set of possible supply quantities
at each hypothetical ruling price.
In experiments 1-8 each buyer and
seller is allowed to make a contract for
the exchange of only a single unit of
the commodity during any one trading
or market period. This rule was for the
sake of simplicity and was relaxed in

the various experiments. In the typical
experiment, the market opens for trading period 1. This means that any buyer
(or seller) is free at any time to raise
his hand and make a verbal offer to
buy (or sell) at any price which does
not violate his maximum (or minimum)
reservation price. Thus, in Chart 1, the
buyer holding the $2.50 card might raise
his hand and shout, "Buy at $1.00."

The seller with the $1.50 card might
then shout, "Sell at $3.60." Any seller

(or buyer) is free to accept a bid (or
offer), in which case a binding contract

are no speculative purchases for resale in the same

purchases for resale are permitted if the objective
is to study the role of speculation in the equilibrating
process. One could, for example, permit the carryover of stocks from one period to the next.

4 Owing to limitations of manpower and equipment in experiments 1-8, bids and offers which
did not lead to transactions could not be recorded.
In subsequent experiments a tape recorder was used
for this purpose.

It should be noted that these experiments conform in several important ways
to what we know must be true of many
kinds of real markets. In a real competitive market such as a commodity or
stock exchange, each marketer is likely
to be ignorant of the reservation prices
at which other buyers and sellers are
willing to trade. Furthermore, the only
way that a real marketer can obtain

knowledge of market conditions is to
6 In fact, these schedules are modified as trading
takes place. Whenever a buyer and a seller make
a contract and "drop out" of the market, the demand
and supply schedules are shifted to the left in a

manner (lepen(ling upon the buyer's and seller's
position on the schedules. Hence, the supply and
(leman(l functions continually alter as the trading
process occurs. It is dilfcult to imagine a real market

is forced to provide all of its own "history." These markets are also a replica
of real markets in that they are composed of a practical number of market-

ers, say twenty, thirty, or forty. We do
not require an indefinitely large number
of marketers, which is usually supposed
necessary for the existence of "pure"

competition.
One important condition operating in
our experimental markets is not likely

to prevail in real markets. The experimental conditions of supply and demand

are held constant over several successive
trading periods in order to give any

equilibrating mechanisms an opportuni-

ty to establish an equilibrium over time.
Real markets are likely to be continually subjected to changing conditions of

supply and demand. Marshall was well
aware of such problems and defined equilibrium as a condition toward which the
market would move if the forces of supply and demand were to remain station-

where o is the standard deviation of
exchange prices around the equilibrium

price. Hence, a provides a measure of
exchange price variation relative to the
predicted equilibrium exchange price. As
is seen in Table 1 and the charts for
all tests except test 8, a tends to decline

Turning now to the individual experimental results, it will be observed that
the equilibrium price and quantity are
approximately the same for the supply
and demand curves of tests 2 and 3.
The significant difference in the design
of these two tests is that the supply
and demand schedules for test 2 are
relatively flat, while the corresponding
schedules for test 3 are much more steeply inclined.
Under the Walrasian hypothesis (the
rate of increase in exchange price is an
increasing function of the excess demand
at that price), one would expect the
market in test 2 to converge more rapidly
than that in test 3. As is evident from
comparing the results in Charts 2 and
3, test 2 shows a more rapid and less erratic tendency toward equilibrium. These
results are, of course, consistent with
nmany other hypotheses, including the

dicted or theoretical "equilibrium" price
and quantity for the corresponding experimental market, though such an
equilibrium will not necessarily be
attained or approached in the market.
The performance of each experimental

market is summarized in the diagram
on the right of Charts 1-10, and in
Table 1. Each chart shows the sequence

first transaction was effected at $1.70,
the second at $1.80, and so on, with a
total of five transactions occurring in
trading period 1. These charts show contract price as a function of transaction

number rather than calendar time, the
latter of course being quite irrelevant
to market dynamics.

The most striking general characteris-

tic of tests 1-3, 5-7, 9, and 10 is the
remarkably strong tendency for exchange
prices to approach the predicted equilibrium for each of these markets. As

the exchange process is repeated through
successive trading periods with the same
conditions of supply and demand prevailing initially in each period, the variation in exchange prices tends to decline,
and to cluster more closely around the
equilibrium. In Chart 1, for example, the

variation in contract prices over the five

decrease in supply from SS to S'S'. This was not
planned. It was due to the inability of one subject

the equilibrium price $10.75. The tentative hypothesis was that the large rent
($6.75) enjoyed by the marginal seller,
with still larger rents for the intramarginal sellers, might prevent the theoretical equilibrium from being established.
From the results it is seen that the

earlier conjecture concerning the effect
of a divergence between buyer and seller
rent on the approach to equilibrium is

confirmed. The approach to equilibrium
is from below, and the convergence is
relatively slow. However, there is no
indication that the lack of marginal sellers near the theoretical equilibrium has
prevented the equilibrium from being
attained. The average contract price in
trading period 4 is $10.90, only $0.15
above the predicted equilibrium.
At the close of trading period 4 in

test 6A, the old buyer cards corresponiding to DD were replaced by new cards

coefficient of convergence increased from
2.9 per cent in the second trading period

given period. Each trader can experiment

to 7.4 and 7.0 per cent in the last two
periods. At the close of the fourth trading

period, the market rules were changed
to allow buyers to make quotations as
well as sellers. Under the new rules (test
8B) two trading periods were run. Ex-

change prices immediately moved toward
equilibrium with the closing prices of

period 1 and opening prices of period
2 being above the equilibrium for the
first time since period 1 of test 8A.
It would seem to be of some significance that of the ten experiments reported on, test 8 shows the clearest lack
of convergence toward equilibrium. More
experiments are necessary to confirm or
deny these results, but it would appear
that important changes in market organization-such as permitting only sellers to make quotations-have a distinctly (listurbing effect on the equilibrating

more in a given market-correcting his
bids or offers in the light of any surprises

or disappointments resulting from his
first contract. In the previous experi-

ments such corrections or alterations in
the bargaining behavior of a trader had
to await the next trading period once
the trader had made a contract.11
"1 This process of correction over time, based

upon observed price quotations and the actual contracts that are executed, is the underlying adjustment mechanism operating in all of these experi-

ments. This is in contrast with the Walrasian tdtonnement or groping process in which "when a price
is cried, and the effective demand and offer corresponding to this price are not equal, another price
is cried for which there is another corresponding
effective demand and offer" (see Leon Walras, Elements of Pure Economics, trans. William Jaffe [Chi-

cago: Richard D. Irwin, Inc., 1954], p. 242). The
Walrasian groping process suggests a centralized
institutional means of trying different price quotations until the equilibrium is discovered. In our
experiments, as in real markets, the groping process
is decentralized, with all contracts binding whether
they are at equilibrium or non-equilibrium prices.

4. Markets whose institutional organi-

quotations may exhibit weaker equilibrium tendencies than markets in which
both buyers and sellers make price quotations-perhaps even disequilibrium tendencies. Such one-sided markets may operate to the benefit of buyers. A possible
explanation is that in the price-formation
process buyers reveal a minimum of in-

specifying the exact character of any
findings, whether those findings are ulti-

mately verified or not. In this spirit,
the following tentative conclusions are

offered concerning these experiments:

1. Even where numbers are "small,"
there are strong tendencies for a supply

be attained as long as one is able to
prohibit collusion and to maintain ab-
