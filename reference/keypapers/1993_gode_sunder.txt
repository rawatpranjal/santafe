Allocative Efficiency of Markets with
Zero-intelligence Traders: Market as a Partial

Substitute for Individual Rationality

Dhananjay K. Gode and Shyam Sunder
Carnegie Mellon University

We report market experiments in which human traders are replaced
by "zero-intelligence" programs that submit random bids and offers.
Imposing a budget constraint (i.e., not permitting traders to sell
below their costs or buy above their values) is sufficient to raise the
allocative efficiency of these auctions close to 100 percent. Allocative
efficiency of a double auction derives largely from its structure, independent of traders' motivation, intelligence, or learning. Adam
Smith's invisible hand may be more powerful than some may have
thought; it can generate aggregate rationality not only from individual rationality but also from individual irrationality.

Becker (1962) proved that several basic features of economics such

as downward-sloping demand functions and upward-sloping supply
functions can be derived as market-level consequences of agents' random choice behavior subject to a budget constraint. He pointed out
that "households may be irrational and yet markets quite rational"
An earlier version of this paper, "Human and Artificially Intelligent Traders in
Computer Double Auctions," was presented at the meetings of the Economic Science
Association at Tucson, Arizona, on October 29, 1989. We have benefited from comments received at this meeting and at workshops at Santa Fe Institute, Yale University,
University of Bonn, Kobe University, Indian Institute of Management at Ahmedabad,
Universitat Pompeu Fabra, University of Minnesota, and Carnegie Mellon University.

(p. 8) and that we should not impute all observed irrationalities of
individuals to markets or impute all rationality of markets to their
participants.

Smith (1962) presented evidence that Walrasian tatonnement, con-

ducted by a central auctioneer, is not necessary for market outcomes
to closely approximate economic equilibrium, even with a handful of
traders. Smith modeled his simple classroom markets after the double
auction of stock and commodity exchanges. These markets are decentralized systems in which each contract is binding. Such markets allowed the traders-mostly students motivated by money or course

credit-to extract virtually 100 percent of the maximum exploitable
(i.e., equilibrium) surplus. Equilibrium predictions of economic theory can accurately describe the outcomes of many trading inechanisms, not just Walrasian tatonnement, in a variety of environments
(see Plott [1982] for a survey).
Performance of an economy is the joint result of its institutional
structure, market environment, and agent behavior. Institutional

structure is defined by the rules that govern exchange, market environment by agents' tastes and endowments of information and resources, and agents' behavior by their trading strategy (see Smith
1982). Standard economic theory is built on two specific assumptions:
utility-maximizing behavior and the institution of Walrasian tatonnement. Becker showed that the market-level predictions of economic
theory are consistent with individual behaviors more general than
utility maximization, whereas Smith showed that such predictions are
consistent with trading mechanisms more general than Walrasian tatonnement.

This paper is an attempt to synthesize these seminal generalizations

by Becker and Smith. Becker assumed that the supply and demand

functions yield equilibrium results through the traditional tatonnement mechanism; Smith's subjects were motivated to seek trading
profits. We show that a double auction, a non-Walrasian market

mechanism, can sustain high levels of allocative efficiency even if
agents do not maximize or seek profits. In its first-order magnitude,
allocative efficiency seems to be a characteristic of the market structure and the environment; rationality of individual traders accounts

for a relatively small fraction (second- or third-order magnitude) of
the efficiency.
It is not possible to control the trading behavior of individuals.

Human traders differ in their expectations, attitudes toward risk,
preferences for money versus enjoyment of trading as a game, and

many other respects. The problem of separating the joint effects of
these variations, unobservable to the researcher, can be mitigated by
studying market outcomes with participants who follow specified

rules of behavior. We therefore replaced human traders by computer
programs.

To isolate the effect of market rules and agent behavior on market

performance, we proceed in three steps. First, in Section I we select
two types of market participants: profit-motivated human traders and

"zero-intelligence" (ZI) machine traders.' Second, in Section II we
observe the performance of a double auction with human traders

and with ZI traders. In one set of ZI markets, the traders are subject
to the budget constraint; in the second set of ZI markets, the budget
constraint is absent. Third, in Sections III and IV we compare these

observations to isolate the performance characteristics of the markets,
which can be attributed to their structure. Section V contains a summary and some concluding remarks.

I. Traders

The performance of markets with human traders (graduate students

of business) is compared to the performance of markets with machine
traders. Each ZI trader generated random bids or offers (depending

on whether it was a buyer or a seller) distributed independently,
identically, and uniformly over the entire feasible range of trading
prices from 1 to 200: [probability(bid = i) = 1/200; i = 1, 2, ... .

200] and [probability(offer = j) = 1/200; j = 1, 2, . . , 200]. It
has no intelligence, does not seek or maximize profits, and does not

observe, remember, or learn. It seems appropriate to label it as a
zero-intelligence trader.
While human traders were unique, 12 identical ZI traders partici-

pated in each market. Experiments were conducted at Carnegie Mellon's Laboratory for Market Design using Market-200 1 software,
which permits both human and machine traders to operate in the
same environment.

II. Market Mechanism

A double auction is a multilateral process in which buyers as well as
sellers can freely enter limit orders (bids or asks) and accept asks or
I These ZI traders are not intended as descriptive models of individual behavior.
For strategic models of individual behavior, see Garcia (1980), Garcia and Zangwill
(1981), and Wilson (1987); for nonstrategic models, see Easley and Ledyard (1992)
and Friedman (1984, 1991); and for double-auction trading algorithms, see Rust,
Palmer, and Miller (1992). In the sense that Friedman (1991) and Easley and Ledyard
(1992) moved away from strategic modeling of individual behavior, the ZI model can
be thought of as extending their idea to an extreme limit. See also Cason and Friedman
(1992) for an empirical comparison of the predictions of the Wilson (1987) and Friedman (1991) models against the ZI benchmark.

bids entered by others. We chose this mechanism for two reasons.
First, major stock, commodity, currency, and many other markets are

organized as double auctions. Second, laboratory double auctions
with human traders are known to yield data that approximate the

equilibrium predictions of economic theory in a variety of environments.

In a double auction any buyer can enter a bid by stating his or her
identity, unit price, and quantity. The same buyer or other buyers
can subsequently raise the bid. Similarly, any seller can enter an ask by

stating quantity and price. If bids and asks match or cross, a binding
transaction occurs. Any buyer is free to accept the outstanding ask
and any seller is free to accept the outstanding bid at any time to
conclude a transaction.

There are several variations of the double auction. We made three
choices to simplify our implementation of the double auction. Each

bid, ask, and transaction was valid for a single unit. A transaction
canceled any unaccepted bids and offers. Finally, when a bid and ask
crossed, the transaction price was equal to the earlier of the two.
Each double auction consisted of 12 traders, equally divided into
two groups: buyers and sellers. Smith's (1976) induced value mechanism was used to implement demand and supply in these markets.

Each market was run for six periods of specified duration (4 minutes
for human traders and 30 seconds for machine traders). We chose
the duration of each period to allow sufficient time for trading. At
the beginning of each period, each buyer was endowed with the right
to buy one or more units of an unspecified commodity. The buyer

was privately informed of the redemption value vi of each unit i, and
the buyer's profit from buying this unit at price pi was given by vi -

Pi. Redemption values vi, i = 1, 2, . . . , n, defined the individual

buyer's demand function for the commodity. Since redemption values of each buyer were private, the market demand function was
unknown to the buyers. At the beginning of each period, sellers were
endowed with the right to sell one or more units of the commodity,
c- being the cost of the ith unit to the seller. The seller's profit from

selling the ith unit at price pi was Pi- ci. Sellers had no fixed costs
and incurred costs only for units sold. The market supply function
was unknown to the sellers. Every trader had to trade the ith unit
before trading the (i + I)th unit.2 Points earned by human traders
were included in the grading scheme for a credit course.
Market rules impose a budget constraint on the participants by
2 Double-auction markets with a single unit per trader also yield results similar to
those reported here (see Gode and Sunder 1992b).

requiring traders to settle their accounts. As shown by Becker (1962),

merely imposing a budget constraint on random agent behavior induces enough regularity in aggregate market behavior to yield downward-sloping demand and upward-sloping supply functions. To explore the consequences of the budget constraint or market discipline,
we placed the ZI traders in two versions of the double auction.

In the first version, ZI traders were subject to the budget constraint:
if they generated a bid (to buy) above their redemption value or an

offer (to sell) below their cost, such actions were considered invalid
and were ignored by the market. In other words, the market forbade
traders to buy or sell at a loss because then they would not have been
able to settle their accounts. Therefore, the support of the distribu-

tion that generated the uniform random bids was restricted between
one and the redemption value of the bidder. Similarly, uniform distribution of random asks was restricted to the range between the seller's

cost and 200. These markets are labeled "ZI with constraint" (ZI-C).
In the second version, the ZI traders were freed from the market
discipline. The budget constraint was removed and random bids and

offers were permitted over the entire range (1-200) without regard
to the buyers' redemption values and sellers' costs. Buyers and sellers
were free to engage in money-losing transactions that they could not
settle. This version of markets is labeled "ZI unconstrained" (ZI-U).
The difference between the performance of the human markets
and that of the ZI-C markets is attributable to systematic characteristics of human traders. If ZI-C traders can be considered to have zero
rationality, this difference in performance would be a measure of the
contribution of human rationality to market performance. On the
other hand, the difference between the performance of markets that
do impose a budget constraint on ZI traders and the performance of
those that do not is attributable to the market discipline. Traders
have no intelligence in either the ZI-U or the ZI-C market; the ZI-C
market prevents the traders from engaging in transactions that they
cannot settle. Consequently, we can attribute the differences in market outcomes to the discipline imposed by the double auction on
traders.

The demand and supply schedules are shown on the left side of

with human traders is attributable to intelligence and profit motiva-

tion, and how much is attributable to the market discipline (see panels

1 and 3 of figs. 1-5)? The middle panels of figures 1-5 show the
time series of prices in markets 1-5 when they were populated by
the ZI-C traders.

Three features of the ZI-C price series should be noted. First, in
contrast to the human trader data in panel 3 and as in the ZI-U

trader data in panel 1, this series shows no signs of learning from
period to period; the series from every period are statistically identical. This is to be expected because the ZI traders cannot remember
or adapt. Second, the volatility of this price series is greater than the
volatility of the price series from human markets, but less than the
volatility of ZI-U markets. Imposing a budget constraint on ZI traders
is sufficient to shift the market performance toward the human mar-

ket performance. Third, the ZI-C price series, though more volatile
than the human market price series, converges slowly toward equilibrium within each period. This can be confirmed from figure 6, which

plots the root mean squared deviation of transaction prices from the
equilibrium price averaged across the six periods of a market. Markets with ZI-U traders do not converge, markets with human traders

converge quickly, and markets with ZI-C traders converge slowly to
the equilibrium price. Regression of the root mean squared deviation
on the transaction sequence number yields significantly negative

slopes for the ZI-C markets but not for the ZI-U markets. By the end
of a period, the price series in ZI-C trader markets converges to the

equilibrium level almost as precisely as the price series from human
trader markets does. The regression results for Z1-C are shown in
table 1.

Since the ZI traders have no memory of events within the current
or the past periods, this convergence cannot be attributed to learning
from market participation. Instead, the difference between the top

and the middle panels of figures 1-5 is caused solely by the progressive narrowing of the opportunity sets of ZI-C traders. The left end
of the market demand function represents units with higher redemption values. Expected values of the bids generated for these units by
ZI-C traders are also higher. Therefore, these units are likely to be
traded earlier than units further down the market demand function.
As the higher-value units are traded, the upper end of the support
of ZI-C bids shifts down. Similarly, as the lower-cost units are sold
earlier in a period, the lower end of the support of ZI-C offers moves
up.

This means that the feasible range of transactions prices narrows
as more units are traded. Though individual units may not be traded
in the order in which they appear in the market demand and supply
functions, there is a greater probability that the last transaction repre-

sents an exchange between the marginal buyer and the marginal

seller.5 If the surplus associated with the marginal units is smaller,
then the range of feasible transaction prices is also narrower, increasing the probability that the market prices will converge to the equilibrium price. If the marginal units involve a larger surplus, conver-

gence will be correspondingly less precise. In either case, the

convergence of transaction prices to the proximity of the theoretical
equilibrium price in ZI-C markets is a consequence of the market
discipline; traders' attempts to maximize their profits, or even their
ability to remember or learn about events of the market, are not
necessary for such convergence.

Efficiency

Following Smith (1962), one can define allocative efficiency of markets as the total profit actually earned by all the traders divided by

the maximum total profit that could have been earned by all the
traders (i.e., the sum of producer and consumer surplus). Figure 7
and table 2 show the period-by-period efficiency of the five markets
under the three modes of operation. The efficiency of markets with
ZI-U traders is constant across periods (see the dotted line in fig. 7).

Since the budget constraint is absent, the maximum possible number

of units (equal to the lower of the total units sellers are allowed to

sell and the total units the buyers are allowed to buy) is always traded.
5The Spearman rank correlation between the actual and the efficient order of sur-

plus extracted is, on average, highest for ZI-C traders (.74), lowest for ZL-U traders
(.42), and in between the two for human traders (.52). The correlation for ZL-U traders
(arising out of the rule that higher-value/lower-cost units of a given trader must be
traded first) can be thought of as the baseline correlation for these markets. Higher
correlations for ZI-C markets suggest that a greater part of their efficiency may be
attributable to the statistical consequences of market rules. Human traders, acting
strategically, may be able to extract the same surplus in spite of a lower correlation
between the actual and the efficient order of trading.

FIG. 7.-Periodwise efficiency (percentage of total surplus extracted) of five markets.
In contrast to human markets, the efficiency of the ZI-U and ZI-C markets in each
period is an independently and identically distributed random variable with no change
across periods since these traders do not learn.

Not only is the total positive surplus extracted, but the maximum
possible negative surplus is also extracted. Negative surplus is extracted because extramarginal units are traded at a loss. Therefore,
the efficiency of these markets depends on the shape of the demand

and supply functions to the left as well as to the right of the equilibrium point.6 As can be seen in table 2, this baseline efficiency was
chosen to lie in the range of 48.8 percent (for market 4) to 90 percent
(for markets 1 and 2). When one allows the demand and supply
functions to extend far enough to the right of the equilibrium point,
it is possible to lower this efficiency without limit (including negative
levels).

The efficiency of human markets is 100 percent in most periods,

with an occasional shortfall of a few percentage points in all markets

except market 5 (see the solid line in fig. 7). In most of these markets,
6 Gode and Sunder (1992b) present results to explain why and how the shape of the
demand and supply functions to the right of the equilibrium point affects the expected
efficiency of double auctions.

efficiency fell short of 100 percent in the first period and climbed to
almost 100 percent in the later periods.7 The average efficiency across
the 29 periods of the human markets 1-5 is 97.9 percent. This level
of efficiency is consistent with other research into human double auc-

tions. Human traders learn quickly (within one or two trading periods) and then stay virtually 100 percent efficient for the remaining

periods. The efficiency of human markets is not sensitive to the baseline efficiency attained with ZI-U traders because profit-seeking human traders refuse to exchange extramarginal units at a loss.
Surprisingly, the efficiency of ZI-C markets is hardly distinguishable from the efficiency of human markets (see the dashed line in fig.
7). The market discipline seems to raise efficiency from the baseline

level to the 96-100 percent range (average efficiency for the five

markets is 98.7 percent). In the absence of these results, one might
have attributed the high efficiency of the markets with human traders

to their rationality, motivation, memory, or learning. Since our ZI
traders, bereft of such faculties, exhibit comparable performance, the
validity of such attribution is doubtful. Note that we do not wish to

argue that the human traders behaved like our ZI traders in the
market.8 Our point is that imposing market discipline on random,
unintelligent behavior is sufficient to raise the efficiency from the
baseline level to almost 100 percent in a double auction. The effect
of human motivations and cognitive abilities has a second-order magnitude at best.

Distribution of Profits across Individuals
Figure 8 and table 3 show the cross-sectional root mean squared dif-

ference between the actual profits and the equilibrium profits of individual traders.9 While there are no significant differences in the abilities of human and ZI-C traders to extract the total surplus in these
double-auction markets, there are significant differences in the way
this total surplus is distributed across the individual traders. The
profit dispersion is greatest in the ZI-U markets (see the dotted line

in fig. 8) and lowest in the human markets (see the solid line).'0 Profit
7 In period 5 of market 2, one trader made an order-of-magnitude keyboard error
in his bid, causing efficiency-reducing extramarginal units to be traded.

8 They obviously did not. Human markets exhibit a pattern of lower efficiency in

the first period, followed by higher efficiency in the later periods; the performance of
the ZI traders is, by design, statistically identical across all periods.

9 Let ai and rr be the actual and theoretical equilibrium profits of trader i, i = 1, ... I
n. Then profit dispersion is given by [n'1 X,(a, - 7i)2i5.

10 An occasional large value of this coefficient in human markets occurred because
a keyboard error by a trader caused a transaction to take place at a price far removed
from the equilibrium and adjacent transaction prices.

dispersion in ZI-C markets (see the dashed line) is close to the human
markets but has a greater magnitude. Profit dispersion decreases in
later periods in two out of five human markets. Without memory or
learning, the ZI markets exhibit no such trend. These results suggest

that, in contrast to aggregate efficiency, distributional aspects of market performance may be sensitive to human motivation and learning.

V. Concluding Remarks

The primary cause of the high allocative efficiency of double auctions
is the market discipline imposed on traders; learning, intelligence, or
profit motivation is not necessary. The same market discipline also

plays an important role in the convergence of transaction prices to
equilibrium levels.

We examined the behavior of markets with zero-intelligence traders that submit random bids and offers. In contrast to the evolutionary models of Alchian (1950) and Nelson and Winter (1982), natural
selection plays no role in arriving at our conclusions; the surplus
extraction property of double auctions is attained by an unchanging

population of ZI traders. The absence of rationality and motivation

in the traders seems to be offset by the structure of the auction market
through which they trade. The rules of this auction exert a powerful
constraining force on individual behavior.
Becker (1962) showed that price changes alter the opportunity set

of consumers in such a way that even if they choose randomly from
this set, the expected demand function is downward sloping; the assumption of utility maximization is not necessary to generate a downward slope. Our results are analogous to Becker's in the sense that
the convergence of price to equilibrium and the extraction of almost

all the total surplus seem to be consequences of the double-auction
rules.

Our findings have several interesting implications. First, the extraction of surplus appears to be a characteristic of this auction and the

environment in which it is conducted; striving by individual participants to maximize their profits is not necessary for the extraction of
surplus."
Second, since stronger forms of individual rationality reduce the
cross-sectional dispersion of the profits of traders, the maximization
assumption may still be quite relevant to the equity considerations.
Paradoxically, profit maximization seems to be associated with low-

ering, not raising, profit dispersion across individuals. In addition, a
lower price variability in markets populated by human traders (who
attempt to increase their profits) suggests that other aspects of market
behavior may be sensitive to profit-maximizing behavior.
Third, in the experimental economics literature, the percentage of
the maximum possible surplus extracted has often been used as an
index of learning and rationality and of the control attained in an
experimental economy. Such inferences may not be appropriate for
market mechanisms that yield all their surplus to ZI traders.
Fourth, we already know that when double-auction markets aggregate and disseminate information about the state of the world, human
traders can significantly improve their ability to extract surplus
through learning (see Plott and Sunder 1982, 1988). When populated
by ZI traders, such markets may be less efficient. More work is needed
to separate the effects of the structure from profit-oriented trader
behavior on market performance.
Finally, our results may help reconcile the predictions of neoclassical economic theory with its behavioral critique. Economic models
assume utility-maximizing agents to derive market equilibria and

11 Gode and Sunder (1992a) examine a broader class of economic institutions (vari
ous types of sealed-bid and double auctions) and show that even sealed-bid markets
can be highly efficient with budget-constrained ZI traders.

their welfare implications. Since such maximization is not always con-

sistent with direct observations of individual behavior, some social
scientists doubt the validity of the market-level implications of models
based on the maximization assumption. Our results suggest that such

maximization at the individual level is unnecessary for the extraction
of surplus in aggregate.' Adam Smith's invisible hand may be more

powerful than some may have thought: when embodied in market
mechanisms such as a double auction, it may generate aggregate rationality not only from individual rationality but also from individual

irrationality.
