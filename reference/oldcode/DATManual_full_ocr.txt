CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION

This chapter describes the Double Auction (DA), includin g the specific conventions of the Santa Fe
Institute's implementation. It provides an example of part of a game, raisin g some of the strategy
issues. It also gives a broad overview of how the computerized tournament works, and a guide to
the rest of the documentation.

Background

The Double Auction (DA) is a type of trading institution used by the New York Stock Exchange,
the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, and many other securities and commodity exchanges
throughout the world. In the DA, buyers and sellers are simultaneously able to call out "bids"
(offers to buy) and "offers" (offers to sell), or to accept the lowest outstanding offer or highest
outstanding bid at any point in the trading process. The rapid flow of information combined with
the ability of traders to undercut instantly any outstanding bid or offer makes the DA perhaps the
closest embodiment of the economist's notion of a perfect frictionless market. The efficiency
properties of these markets are legendary and have been extensively studied in laboratory
experiments using human subjects (see surveys by Plott, 1982 and Smith, 1982a),

In order to gain a deeper understanding of strategic choice in the DA, the Santa Fe Institute is
sponsoring a computerized DA tournament. One goal of this tournament is to analyze the game
when played by computerized trading strategies. To date, formal game-theoretic analysis of the
dynamic DA game has not been forthcoming due to its inherent complexity. Thus insights gained
into the nature of the decision processes actually employed in such situations could ultimately
prove useful for improving our understanding of certain market phenomena such as the stock
market crash in Fall 1987. Recent interest on Wall Street about the impact of computerized trading
programs on market stability makes this analysis particularly timely.

The inspiration for a computerized DA comes in part from Axelrod's (1984) "prisoner's dilemma"
tournament. By allowing alternative algorithms to compete against one another, we can generate
an easily controlled experimental environment. Within this environment, a variety of experiments
can be performed on the submitted algorithms. This will allow us to evaluate carefully the
important elements of each strategy, and to develop new insights into the game. A priori it is
difficult to predict which strategies will perform well. Will complex Strategies be more effective
than simple ones? Can information about one's opponents be productively exploited? Are there
strategies which can perform well in a variety of environments (for example, large versus small
markets)? How will the strategies perform against human traders? Can the behavior of the
computerized strategies be easily distinguished from human players? How well will the
computerized double auction market operate? Will it result in highly efficient allocations as is
observed in human DA markets? Will the market quickly stabilize at the competitive equilibrium

allocations, or will instabilities such as market bubbles and crashes arise?

To provide strong incentives for the submission of well developed strategies, prize money in the
amount of $10,000 will be distributed among the participants. Payments will be proportional to
the trading profits earned by the participant's strategy in the tournament. Algorithms are being
solicited from individuals with a variety of backgrounds including business school students,
computer scientists, economists, game theorists, learning theory specialists, and possibly even
traders from real exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Board of
Trade. It is our hope that these algorithms will embody a variety of strategic approaches, from
simple, intuitive "rules-of-thumb" to sophisticated programs utilizing complex statistical, adaptive,
and learning algorithms.

The idea of running a Double Auction Tournament originated in the March, 1988 meeting of the
Economy Program of the Santa Fe Institute. The original protocol was designed by Richard Palmer
and John Rust. The experimental design of the tournament was developed jointly by John Miller,
Palmer and Rust, with comments from Robert Axelrod, Charles Plott, Vernon Smith, and Shyam
Sunder, A prototype version of the DA software was written in the Gauss programming language
(for IBM PC's) by Rust in December, 1988, The software design is due Palmer and Miller. The
tournament software was written by Palmer (monitor, DANI, C and Fortran players) and Miller
(Pascal players), with assistance and advice from Rust, Stephen Pope, and Michael Angerman.
George Tsibouris and Palmer wrote the PC graphics routines using Turbo-C, The documentation
was written by Palmer, with assistance from Miller and Rust.

1.2. The Computerized Double Auction

The structure of our computerized DA game is very similar, but not identical, to the version of the
DA used in laboratory experiments. The main differences are (1) time is divided into discrete bid-
offer and buy-sell steps, and (2) the adoption of Chicago rules, i.e. that only the current bidder and
current offerer can accept the current offer and bid, respectively (these concepts are defined
below). The time discretization was adopted to simplify the synchronization of communications in
a multi-processing or network environment with delays that may vary from player to player or
moment to moment. Chicago Rules were chosen to make our implementation of the DA resemble
the new AURORA computerized DA market created by the Chicago Board of Trade, Having
experimented with alternative sets of trading rules, we found that.the Chicago Rules produce a
"fairer," more strategically interesting version of DA without much random tie-breaking.

The rest of this section describes the rules for our game:

1. Hach player in a game is either a buyer or seller of tokens. Playérs can specify which roles
they are willing to play. They are all informed as to how many buyers and sellers there are in
the game. In the tournament a program that can play both roles will play more games, and
hence have more opportunity for profit, than one that can play only one role.

2. A game is divided into:one or more rounds.
3. Each round is divided into one or more periods.

4,  Ineach period, each buyer can buy up to N tokens and each seller can sell up to N tokens. A
TOKEN can be thought of as a fictitious commodity that is being traded in the DA market.
For simplicity, N is the same for all players and all periods in a game, and is between 1 and
4, inclusive. . ;

5. For each round, each buyer is assigned N redemption values, one for each token that could
be bought. If the i'th token bought by a given buyer in a given period has redemption value
R(i), and is bought at a price P(i), then that buyer makes profit R(i)—P() from the
transaction, Thus buyers try to buy tokens as cheaply as possible below their redemption
values. Redemption values are given in decreasing order, and are assumed to be used in that
order since it maximizes profit.

6. Foreach round, each seller is assigned N token costs, one for each token that could be sold.
If the i'th token sold by a given seller in a given period has token cost C(i), and is sold at a
price P(i), then that seller makes profit P(i}—C(i) from the transaction. Thus sellers try sell
tokens for as much as possible above their token costs. Token costs are given in increasing
order, and are assumed to be used in that order since it maximizes profit.

Redemption values and token costs in general are different for each player, and are private
information not communicated to other players. ;

Note that redemption values and token costs are the same for each period within a round, but
in general differ from round to round. During a given round, strategies may be able to benefit
from information gathered about opponents! redemption values or token costs in previous
periods.

Each period consists of a number of alternating bid-offer steps and buy-sell steps, starting
with a bid-offer step.

In a bid-offer step each buyer who has not already bought N tokens in that period may make
a bid to buy one token. The buyer specifies the price of the bid; prices must be integers. If
there is already a current bid (see below) the price must be higher than the current bid price.

In a bid-offer step each seller who has not already sold N tokens in that period may make an
offer to sell one token. The seller specifies the price of the offer; prices must be integers. If
there is already a current offer (see below) the price must be lower than the current offer
price.

At the conclusion of a bid-offer step, the highest bid made becomes the current bid, and the
lowest offer made becomes the current offer. If no new bids were made the previous current .
bid remains if there was one; otherwise there is no current bid. Similarly for offers. Any ties
for highest bid or lowest offer are broken randomly.

All players are informed about all legal bids and offers, and who made them, at the
conclusion of each bid-offer step, At all times they know the current bid and offer (if any),
and who holds them—the current bidder and current offerer.

In a buy-sell step, one or more buyers may ask to accept the current offer; this is a buy
request (see also rule 15). Similarly one or more sellers may ask to accept the current bid;
this is a sell request (see also rule 16). If more than one request occurs, one is selected
randomly; only one transaction (either a buy or a sell) can occur in each buy-sell step.

If there is a current bid, then only the current bidder is eligible to make a buy request. If
there is no current bid, then any buyer who has not already bought N tokens in this period
may make a buy request.

If there is a current offer, then only the current offerer is eligible to make a sell request. If
there is no current offer, then any seller who has not already sold N tokens in this period may
make a sell request.

When a transaction occurs the transaction price is equal to either the current offer (if a buy
request was accepted), or to the current bid (if a sell request was accepted). Both the buyer
and seller involved receive profit as described above (see rules 5 and 6), and consume one of
their N tokens.

All players are informed about all transactions that occur. The information consists of the
transaction price, the identity of the buyer and seller involved, and whether it was a buy or a
sell request that was accepted. They are not informed about other buy or sell requests that
were not accepted.

If a transaction occurs in a buy-sell step, then both the current bid and the current offer are
cleared before the next bid-offer step. Otherwise they are retained.

Double Auction Tournament -4- Participant's Manual
1.3 An Example

A simple example will serve to clarify the above definition of the game, and to raise some of the
strategy issues.

We focus on a single seller $1 in a game with three buyers (B1, B2, and B3) and three sellers (S1,
§2, and $3). We consider only the first few steps of one period of the game. -Our seller S1 was
assigned four tokens with the following token costs for the round we are examining:

100 200 300 400

The first few steps are shown in the following table, in a format based on the monitor's listfile
display (see the "monitor" chapter of the documentation for full details), constituting the
information available to $1. The left-hand columns show the time and step type (BO = bid-offer,
BS = buy-sell). The right-hand columns show the current bid and current offer after each step,
and the price of each transaction that occurs. The participants in a transaction are shown by >'s
(for a sell) or <'s (for a buy). _ ,

BS - 125 225
6 BO 150 180* | 215 200* 215 180 200
BS < < | 200

BID-OFFER STEP 1:

The period begins, and our seller is called on to make an offer. She has no information about the
other players, and can only judge an appropriate offer value by looking at her own token costs
(100, 200, 300, 400). She could do nothing, and see what the others do, but she decides to make
an offer of 410. If accepted this would yield her a profit of 410 - 100 = 310.

Her offer turns out to be the lowest among the three sellers (see the table) and so becomes the
current offer. On the buyer's side the highest bid was 75, which thus becomes the current bid.
The current bid and current offer are marked by asterisks (*) in the table.

BUY-SELL STEP 1: .

Because she is the current offerer, our seller is now eligible to make a sell request, to sell her first
token to the current bidder (B2) at the current bid price of 75. But that would be foolish; she
would make a loss of 25. So she does nothing.

The current bidder also has the option of making a buy request, to buy a token from our seller at

her current offer price of 410. She'd be happy if he did so (giving her 310 in profit), but he
doesn't.

Double Auction Tournament -5- Participant's Manual
This illustrates a general feature of the buy-sell step. It can be thought of as a two-person game
between the current bidder and the current offerer, and each hopes that the other will accept.
Besides locking in a profit, the incentive to make a buy or sell request oneself is mainly not to have
to play another bid-offer step, with the consequent risk of losing the bidding or offering lead.
There may also be an incentive to make a trade before time runs out towards the end of a period.

BID-OFFER STEP 2

Given that her outstanding current offer of 410 was not accepted, our seller decides to lower her
offer to 350. Here she must strike a balance between going too low, and thus losing potential
profit, and not going low enough to win the current offer. Ideally she would guess the best offer
of the other sellers, and then go just below it (assuming she could still make a profit), As it is, she
doesn't go low enough; seller $2 beats her with an offer of 330. The current bid for the buyers
increases to 130.

The bid-offer step can be thought of as. an n-person game between the n buyers, and an m-person
game between the m sellers. Actually it may not always be advantageous to win the bidding. One
strategy is to “hang behind" the leaders until a transaction seems imminent, and then to jump in just
ahead of the competition. But this requires good knowledge of the others’ probable behavior.

BUY-SELL STEP 2

Again no transaction occurs. In fact this is the normal state of affairs; there are typically far more
Steps in a period than there are tokens to be traded, so transactions occur relatively infrequently.
One strategy is to make a buy or sell request as soon as a "reasonable" profit can be made, before
"all the best buys are gone." Though this may give early profit in a game, it does not necessarily
make the most profit; holding out for a better price may do better.

BID-OFFER STEP 3
Our seller goes down to 250 and again gets the lead. Meanwhile the buyers come up to 175.
BUY-SELL STEP 3

Our seller again has a chance to request a sell, and this time she chooses to do so. It is accepted
and she has made a_.profit of 175—100 = 75. -

We don't know whether the current bidder B3 made a simultaneous buy request; if he did there
was a random draw, which $1 must have "won." This is a random draw it is not good to win; if
B3 had won the draw the transaction price would have been 250 instead of 175, actually doubling
our seller's profit.

BID-OFFER STEP 4

Because a transaction occurred, the current bid and offer have been removed (see the right-hand
columns). So now S1 can make any bid she likes. One strategy here is to jump close to the
previous transaction price; another is to start far away and work slowly back towards it. The latter
gives more information, and is perhaps more likely to convince the buyers to accept a higher price,
but is thwarted by just one seller employing the "let's get right back near the last price" approach.

Our seller decides to make a high offer of 400. But $3 jumps in with a much lower offer, at 250,
Note that on the buyer's side there was a tie for the current bid, and B1 was randomly chosen.

Double Auction Tournament -6- Participant's Manual

neste setere rat
BUY-SELL STEP 4
No transaction occurs.
BID-OFFER STEP 5

Our seller now has a rather limited range in which to make a new offer; she must go below the
current offer of 250, but obviously wants to stay above her next token cost of 200 (recall that she
sold her first token, and is now onto her second). She splits the difference at 225, and wins the
current bid.

BUY-SELL STEP 5

No transaction occurs. Our seller is eligible to accept the current bid of 125, but would make a
loss if she did so.

BID-OFFER STEP 6

S1 is pinned between 200 and 225, She tries 215, but is beaten by S2 at 200. Note that now there
is nothing she can do until after a transaction occurs; the current offer is too low for her to beat
with any hope of profit. Notice that B2 didn't make a bid on this step. This may signify that he
cannot do so profitably, but may also represent a wait-and-see approach.. It could also be that he
didn't respond in time or encountered an error. Watching where other players stop bidding or
offering often gives valuable information, but must be interpreted carefully. Bluffing (by sticking
at one price, even though it may not be close to the token value) is certainly possible.

BUY-SELL STEP 6

B3 accepts $2's offer and a second transaction occurs. There was a tange of only 20 points
between the current bid and offer at this point, Patient players might have continued for several
more steps, with the prices edging together, before concluding a transaction. As the prices come
together, either player can gain more profit by accepting, but both risk losing the bidding/offering
lead to other players.

We leave the detailed example at this point. Several more transactions would probably occur
during this period. Then the next period would begin, with everyone having the same token
values. In this new period our seller might base her offers and sell requests on information gained
in the previous period. She might also want to use some of the information she ignored during the
first period, including the actual bids and offers (whether accepted or not) made by each of her
opponents during the actual play, the transaction prices for the trades that did occur, and so on,
She might also be able to develop a sense of how her opponents are likely to respond (such as the
observation that $3 always seenis to offer 10 points below the previous current offer value when
there was one). This sort of information might even be useful in another round, where the
opponents are the same even though the token values are different.

One of the best ways to understand the rules of the game, as well as to gain insights into potential
strategies, is to actually play some games against a set of sample strategies. This can be done
either on the Santa Fe Token Exchange or entirely on a local computer, as described below and in
the rest of the documentation,

Double Auction Tournament “Te Participant's Manual
1.4 Implementation of the Computerized Double Auction

The Santa Fe Institute's implementation of a computerized double auction is based on two
principles:

1. The players in a game are represented by separate independent programs. This allows easy
development of players in a diverse set of languages on a variety of machines, and makes it
easy to construct games between selected subsets of available players.

2. Participants developing strategies only need to understand and work with programming
details related to strategy, not with control, communications, book-keeping, synchronization,
etc, (This is almost but not quite true.)

Principle (1) is realized by having a separate Monitor Program that manages the game. The
players and the monitor are all separate programs. The monitor is NOT an auctioneer; it only
serves to coordinate message-passing between the separate player programs. Thus, all programs
communicate only with the monitor, but not directly with each other. There are various
communication methods that can be used, though not all are available on all systems; these are
discussed in detail in Chapter 2, Software.

Depending on the system, the monitor and players may all be on the same machine, or may be
distributed ona network. At present networking is possible only for TCP/IP communications on
the Internet network. Local players (on the same CPU as the monitor) are normally started up and
controlled by the monitor, according to a list in the "players file." Network players are started up
separately after the monitor is rannin g, and then connect to the monitor.

A networking monitor running re gularly at Santa Fe (every hour on the hour) forms the Santa Fe

Token Exchange (SFTE). Participants with TCP/IP access to the Internet can play practice games-

with the SFTE across the network. Results are mailed back to them automatically. But even if they
can use the SFTE, most participants will want to set up a monitor running on their own computer
too.: Principle (2) is realized by the provision of "skeleton" player programs in C, Fortran, and
Pascal, These programs will run as they are, playing the Double Auction according to a simple
strategy. The strategic parts of these programs are well separated from the control and
communications parts, so that participants can easily identify the routines they need to modify to

implement their own strategy. They should not need to understand the control and

communications parts at all.

In all three languages a standard set of variables specifies the state of the game, and standard
routines are called to request strategic decisions. For example, in a program playing a buyer, a
routine called "bid" is called in each bid-offer step and must return the value of the bid to be made
(or 0 for none). Within the "bid" routine the current status of the game, and some cumulated
history, is available for reference in making the decision. Chapter 3, The Skeleton Programs,
describes the variables and routines in detail.

The initial stages of setting up the Double Auction on a new machine may take a little time, and
might in some cases require help from the organizers, But once a monitor and the skeleton
programs are running, actual development of a Strategy should be simple (at least from a
programming standpoint) and can entirely ignore all the communication and control issues.

A special player program called the "human player" provides an interface so that participants can

themselves play a game against computer players. This may be done both on the SFTE and with a
monitor running locally.

Double Auction Tournament -8- Participant's Manual
The monitor, skeleton players, and associated support software have been tested and debugged on
a variety of machines and systems including:

Unix systems (BSD and System V)
IBM PC's and compatibles
Vax/VMS

Cray/Unicos

The organizers will advise on porting the software to further systems, and will help with it when
appropriate. Note that porting to a Macintosh is NOT possible, due to operating system
limitations.

All the software is available from the Santa Fe Institute, via electronic file transfer (anonymous ftp
or electronic mail), or on floppy disks. Chapter 2, The Software, gives detailed instructions for
obtaining it. Knowledgeable ftp users can look directly in pub/dat by anonymous ftp at
sfi.santafe.edu; the README file contains a description of the files.

The documentation itself is also available in electronic form, or can be obtained in printed form
from Santa Fe. A small charge is made for sending disks or printed documentation from Santa Fe.
The software itself is free except for that required to set up a networking monitor other than the
SFTE; this is not normally distributed (in part to encourage use of a single network token
exchange), but may be sold and licensed on request. ;

The actual tournaments will be conducted at Santa Fe, not over the network. Participants will
submit the source of their player programs, or at least the strategic subroutines from those
programs, The "rules" chapter of the documentation contains details.

1.5 Electronic Mailing List
An automatic electronic mailing list is maintained at the Santa Fe Institute for discussions and
announcements relating to the Double Auction Tournament. You will be added to the list when you
make an initial enquiry about the project, or if you ask specifically to be added. .
All mail sent to the e-mail address

dat-list@sfi.santafe.edu
will be sent on automatically to everyone on the mailing list. The list is unmediated, so please be
polite, concise, and considerate. The DAT organizers are themselves on the list and will respond
as appropriate to queries mailed to the list. Individual queries not of general interest should be
mailed to dat, not to dat-list.
For additions, deletions, and changes to the list, please send mail to

dat @sfi.santafe.edu
or  dat-list-request @sfi.santafe.edu

but NOT to the list itself.
All correspondence sent to the mailing list is appended to the file "mail" in the pub/dat directory

accessible by anonymous ftp at sfi.santafe.edu. See Chapter 2 (software) for more information
about ftp.

CHAPTER 2: THE SOFTWARE

This chapter describes the software available. It also explains how to obtain the software and
documentation that you need, and how to start setting it up on your own machine. There are many
details in this chapter, but probably only part of it will apply to you.

2.1 Communication Methods

The first key to understanding the software is a knowledge of the communication methods that can
be used between the monitor and the players.

Note that in all games there is one monitor and at least two separate players. The monitor and each
of the players is a complete program in itself; the players are NOT “subroutines” of the monitor.
The monitor program and the player programs may run simultaneously (either on the same
computer or on different ones connected by the Internet), or one at a time. The players each
communicate only with the monitor, not directly with each other.

The different communication methods are described below. In each case we show only one player
communicating with the monitor, but in a real game there would be more. The monitor can
support any mixture of communication methods that are available on the computer concerned.

Certain facilities are only available to player programs based on the skeleton programs written in
C. Such programs are referred to as "C players" below, and include the human interface.

FILE-BASED COMMUNICATION

This is the slowest communication scheme but is available on all supported systems. It is the
ONLY communication method available on an IBM-PC, or on any other machine that can only run
one program atatime. Suppose the the player program is called PLAYER. Then the following
sequence occurs for each step of the game:

1:

MONITOR ——_——_———p PLAYER.IN

'

PLAYER <4—p PLAYERSAV

'

MONITOR <a  —— PLAYER.OUT

The monitor writes file PLAYER.IN and then starts up the PLAYER, which reads it. The player
writes file PLAYER.OUT, which is then read by the monitor. The monitor itself is suspended
while the PLAYER is running, The PLAYER is started up separately for each step of the game,
and exits after writing PLAYER.OUT. Because the PLAYER is not running continuously it must

Double Auction Tournament -12- Participant's Manual
wed

save its working variables, either in a file called PLAYER.SAV as shown, or (C players only) in
PLAYER.OUT following the output messages.

This communication method is obviously very disk intensive, and also involves many program
launches. It is not recommended when other methods are available. On an IBM-PC it can actually
be made fairly fast by placing the player programs (and thus their .IN, .OUT, and SAV files) on
a RAM disk. See the instructions below. On a Vax/VMS system it is extremely slow.

PIPE-BASED COMMUNICATION
This is the recommended communication method for use between the monitor and each player

when on the same multiprocessing machine. The monitor and players all run simultaneously, and
communicate via "pipes" (or their equivalent, e.g., "mailboxes" in VMS):

— (stdin)
<4 (stdout)

MONITOR PLAYER

There is one pipe for each direction. At the player's end these pipes are arranged to look like the
standard input and output channels, which would normally be attached to the terminal, Thus the
player program can use simple read and write operations without any special knowledge of pipes.

The monitor program is started up first and then starts up all the pipe-based player programs.
They are technically "child processes" (Unix) or "sub-processes" (VMS) of the monitor's own
process. The players keep running until the end of the game or an error; for most errors detected
by the monitor the offending player will be "killed."

There is a modified form of pipe-based communication available only for the C players and the

_human player. The player uses special channels ("descriptors") for the pipes, leaving its standard

input and output free for terminal communication. This is essential for the human player. This
form of communication is called "arg-based communication” because the descriptor numbers are
passed via command-line arguments from the monitor-to the player when the player is started.

INTERNET-BASED COMMUNICATION—DIRECT

Direct Internet communication is available only for the C players and the human player. It allows
such players to connect to the monitor over a TCP/IP Internet communication link:

MONITOR <q—— internet ——>> PLAYER

'

display

The monitor and player programs are usually on different machines at different locations. The
monitor is normally the one at sfi.santafe.edu, called the Santa Fe Token Exchange (SFTE).
The monitor runs at a pre-arranged time (every hour on the hour for the SFTE) and users start up
their players at the appropriate time at the remote sites. The player program itself establishes the
connection to the monitor. The player program can display the progress of the game to the screen
(or to a file) during the game.

Double Auction Tournament -13- Participant's Manual
INTERNET-BASED COMMUNICATION—VIA DANI

The direct Internet-based method described above is only available for the C players and human
player. For other languages the Double Auction Network Interface (DANI) must be used:

MONITOR <4— intemet —»/ DANI | q«—» PLAYER

'

display

DANI acts as a relay for messages between the player and the Internet. It can also display the
progress of the game as it runs. DANI and the player can communicate by any. of the non-Internet
methods described above (file- based, pipe-based, or arg-based). The monitor is started first (at a
prearranged time), and then DANI is started at the remote site. DANI then starts the local player.
DANI can only support one player at a time. :

DANI.can also communicate with the player by some additional methods not discussed here.

Please contact the organizers if you have a special need not covered by the cases presented here.

Using DANI may sometimes be preferred over the direct Internet method even for C players,

because DANI's display format is more compact than the C player's (which is designed primarily
for the human player). Doe .

2.2 Outline of the Software Available
The software available for the Double Auction Tournament consists of the following major parts:

1. The monitor, This is needed if you want to run double auction games on your local machine
or network. Without it you can only play games on the Santa Fe Token Exchange (SFTE),
via the Internet. This is available both in C source form and in IBM-PC executable form.

2. The skeleton players. You will certainly need one of these, in source form; if you plan to
develop your own strategy (without it you can only play via the human interface on the
SFTE, and cannot enter th tournament). They are available in the following. languages:

C for Unix, Vax/VMS, Unicos, Turbo-C, Quick-C Fortran for Unix, Vax/VMS,
Unicos, MS-Fortran, RyanMcFarland, Lahey Pascal for Unix; Vax/VMS, Turbo-
Pascal. .

Using another language (e.g., Lisp, Ada, Basic) is possible for games on the SFTE
(via DANI), but is not acceptable for tournament entries except by prior arrangement
with the organizers.

Using one of the above languages on a different system or compiler will not be difficult
in most cases, though some features may be lackin g. Contact the organizers for advice.

3. The human interface. This allows you to play against computer strategies, either with your
local monitor or on the SFTE. The human player is available in C source form and in IBM-
PC executable form. The C source actually shares much of the code of the C skeleton player
and is packaged with it.

Double Auction Tournament -14- Participant's Manual
Sasa eed

4. DANI: the Double Auction Network Interface. This is needed if you want to play on the
SFTE using a player program based on the Fortran or Pascal skeleton players (or anything
else but C). It may also be useful even with the C players because its output display is
compact. DANT is.available in C source form only.

5, PP: the simple pre-processor. This is a program that processes another program performing
file inclusion, parameter substitution, and conditional compilation (it recognizes a subset of
the C preprocessor directives). It is needed if you want to use the Fortran skeleton player on
a non-Unix machine. It may also be useful for Pascal; see the README file for Pascal. PP
is available in C source form and in IBM-PC executable form.

6. Networking software. The programs described above have only partial networking ability.
The C players and DANI can contact the Santa Fe Token Exchange only, and the monitor
supports only local players (on the same CPU). Only one human player at a time can play in
a local game, because it needs the login terminal. ‘To relax these restrictions, either to set up a
networking monitor (your own token exchange), or to connect to a token exchange other than
the SFTE, you need the full networking software. THIS IS NOT NORMALLY
DISTRIBUTED FREE TO PARTICIPANTS. Contact the organizers for further

information.

Note that while the skeleton players are available in several languages, the rest of the software is
only available in C or in IBM-PC executable form. However you should not need to understand
or modify any of this C-only software—you will just need to compile it once on your system. If
you don't have a C compiler please contact the organizers; we will attempt to supply you with a

binary executable for your machine.
2.3 Obtaining the Software and Documentation
There are three basic ways to obtain the double auction software:

1. Copy it electronically from the public directories of the sfi.santafe.edu computer at Santa
Fe, using ‘ftp’,

2. Request floppy disks from Santa Fe. This is most appropriate if you intend to run the
software on an IBM-PC or compatible.

3. Request that the software (and optionally the documentation) be sent to you by electronic mail
from Santa Fe. ;

The documentation is all available in electronic form (as simple ascii files), and can be included
with any of the above methods, Alternatively you can request printed documentation from Santa
Fe,

These methods are described in more detail in the following subsections.

OBTAINING THE SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION WITH FTP

To obtain files from Santa Fe via ftp, follow the following steps:

1. Connect to sfi.santafe.edu with ftp. On most computers the command "ftp
sfi.santafe.edu” will do this.

2. Specify the user name "anonymous."

Double Auction Tournament -15- Participant's Manual
3. Specify your own last name (up to 8 characters) as the password. You should then get ftp's '
prompt (usually "ftp> ").

ed Double Auction Tournament -17- Participant's Manual
Notes on the above:

1. The .tar.Z files are compressed files that contain the whole directory listed immediately below
them. These are only useful if you have a Unix system with ‘uncompress' and ‘tar’. If you 7
have these you can do the following:

a. Get the .tar.Z files you need USING THE BINARY MODE of ftp.
b. |Uncompress each file (e.g., "uncompress monitor.tar.Z").

c. Unpack each file with tar (e.g., "tar xvpf monitor.tar"). This will make the directory
concerned (e.g., monitor) within your current directory, and fill it with the files.

d. Delete the .tar file.
2. Most directories contain a README file. Read this before attempting to compile.

3. Many directories contain files with scripts for compiling and linking. 'Makefile' is for Unix.
A .prj file is for Turbo-C, A .mak file is for Quick-C. A .com file is for Vax/VMS. Read
these files before using them; there may be things to customize.

4. The dos directory contains executable binaries and graphics files for an IBM-PC. See the |
following section for more details on these files. Be sure to use the binary mode of ftp to
copy such files. They can then be transferred to a PC in several ways (e.g., PC-NFS). If
your interest is just in the PC version, you'll probably find it more convenient to get floppies |
than to try this. ]

OBTAINING THE SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION ON FLOPPY DISKS

If you use an IBM-PC or compatible, it is best to obtain the software on floppy disks. You may
alternatively be able to use the ftp method, but will then have to compile everything rather than .
receiving executables. 7

Ask for floppy disks by writing to:

Double Auction Tournament
Santa Fe Institute

1120 Canyon Road

Santa Fe, NM 87501

Include media/shipping fee of $3 for floppy disks only, or $10 for floppy disks plus complete

printed documentation ($7.50 for documentation only). The full documentation is included on the 4
floppy disks (as simple ascii text files) and is also available via ftp. Unless you make a special id
request, you will receive two floppy disks containing the following:

Certain files not needed on a PC, but which may be needed or useful if you are merely using
PC-floppies to transfer the software to another machine.

Double Auction Tournament -19- Participant's Manual
You should not need any of these for use solely on a PC. If you request it specially, we will send
you "Disk 3" containing all the above files, including a README file that explains its contents.
Please add $1 for this. .

All floppy disks will be 5.25 inch, double-sided, double-density, 362K.

OBTAINING THE SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION BY ELECTRONIC MAIL

This method should only be used if neither of the other two is available. Send your request to:
dat@sfi.santafe.edu

specifying:

1. Your name and institution.

2. Your e-mail address.

3. The type of machine(s) on which you want to run the Double Auction Tournament software.
Specify the operating system (e.g., Unix, VMS) too.

4, The language(s) you want to use for your players (C, Fortran, Pascal).

5. Whether you want the source for the monitor. If you don't gét this you can only play with
the Santa Fe Token Exchange. ,

6. Whether you want to be able to play games with the Santa Fe Token Exchan ge. This is only
possible if your site has the appropriate TCP/IP software and hardware capability.

We will then send you the files we think you need. No individual file will exceed 50K. Files will
be bundled together into .shar files on a Unix system; instructions will be included. Note that
binary files cannot be sent via ordinary e-mail.

2.4 Getting Started

There is a lot of software available, and a lot of documentation. You will not master it all at once.
We suggest the following approach:

FOR UNIX, VMS, ETC. USERS (MULTIPROCESSING MACHINES)—SFTE USAGE

Before you do anything, try to determine if your machine has Internet TCP/IP access using BSD
4,2 or 4.3 calls. If it doesn't you cannot use the Santa Fe Token Exchange; go to the next
subsection. If you can use "telnet" and "ftp" on your machine you probably have the necessary
access, To find out for sure, determine whether the following routines are available in your C
run-time library: .

socket() connect() inet_ntoa()
htonl() htons() beopy() bzero()

The ones on the first line are the truly essential ones. They may be in a special library. First try to
find them via ‘help' (‘man' on a Unix system). Then, if'that fails, ask an expert. Note that for
Vax/VMS there are several implementations of TCP/IP; the Double Auction software currently
only supports the Wollongong WIN/TCP one. If you have a different TCP/IP implementation and
want to use the SFTE, please contact the organizers.

Double Auction Tournament -20- Participant's Manual
If you do have the appropriate TCP/IP access, you can follow the following suggestions to play a
trial game with the SFTE. Otherwise, or if the TCP/IP access is dubious or needs work, proceed
to the next subsection instead.

1.

If you don't have printed documentation, print the appropriate files from the ‘doc’ directory.
To start with you'll want at least "intro," "software," and "players."

Get the source files for the Cc players (even if you ultimately want to use Fortran or Pascal).

Read the README file for the C players and follow the directions therein to compile and link
the players using INETBASED; compile at least "inquire" and the human player (called “hi”
or "human" depending on your system). If you have difficulty just try to compile "inquire."
If that doesn't sicceed please check that you followed the instructions (e.g., did you
customize define.h?) and then contact the organizers (see "Getting Help" below).

Try running "inquire." If it succeeds in connecting to the SFTE, you should get a message
telling you about the schedule of games at Santa Fe, or a message that says a game is about to
begin. If instead it says (possibly after up to a minute or so of trying) that it couldn't connect
to sfi.santafe.edu, the problem may either be with the network or with your machine's
access to it. Try again later, and keep on trying for a day or more before concluding that
there's areal problem. If you have the "ping" command, try "ping sfi.santafe.edu"—if
this responds with "sfi.santafe.edu is alive" then inquire should work too. Asking a
network expert may also help. -

If "inquire" works, try running the human player. Unless you use it at the right time (just

- before any hour), it should give the same message as inquire. Using it just before the hour

should. allow you to play a game with the SFTE. Study the “intro” and (at least briefly)
"players" chapters of the documentation before attempting to play, but don't be afraid to
experiment. Use the "quit" command when you tire of playing. As'long as you completed at
least the first period, you should receive a listing of the whole game by electronic mail after it
is over. Study this in conjunction with the "monitor" chapter of the documentation. Please
tell the organizers if you don't receive a game listing by electronic mail within a few hours of
playing a game. —

You can also try compiling and running a skeleton player (called "di" or “skeleton”
depending on your system). This is actually simpler than the human player. When you run
it at the right time it should play a game with the SFTE, displaying it as it goes.

You now have three directions in which to proceed:

a. If you want to write in C, and only want to use the SFTE (not a local monitor), study
the skeleton.c source file in conjunction with the "skeleton" chapter of the
documentation.

b. If you want to write in Fortran or Pascal, and want to use the SFTE, now is the time to
compile and test DANI and the skeleton player in your chosen language. See the
appropriate README files and the "dani" chapter of the documentation.

c. If you want to set up a local double auction monitor on your machine, follow the
suggestions in the next subsection.

Double Auction Tournament -21- Participant's Manual
FOR UNIX, VMS, ETC. USERS (MULTIPROCESSING MACHINES)—LOCAL MONITOR

In some ways this is the most complicated case because you must compile both the monitor and at +

least one player before you can get anything going.

1.

If you don't have printed documentation, print the appropriate files from the ‘doc’ directory.
To start with you'll want at least "intro," "software," "monitor," and "players."

Get the source files for the monitor and for the players in the language of your choice. We
recommend that you put the player files in a subdirectory of the directory containing the
monitor files.

If your language is not C, also get the C source for the human player. If your language is
Fortran, also get the source files for ‘pp’ if you don't have a standard Unix system (see the
Fortran README file). Make sure you also have any associated README files and
makefiles. Also make sure you have ‘game’ and ‘players' for the monitor and ‘helpfile' for
the human player.

Compile the monitor. See the README file for directions. Try running it without any
command-line arguments: it should read and list the parameters in the 'game' file, and then
stop with a ‘no active buyers or sellers' message. If anything else happens, investigate
before proceeding; first check that 'game' and ‘players’ are in the monitor's own directory
and contain sensible parameters (‘players' should not yet define any players).

Compile the skeleton player in.the language of your choice. See the appropriate README
file for directions. If you choose Fortran you may first need to compile ‘pp’. You will have
to decide on your communication method, either FILEBASED or PIPEBASED; we
recommend PIPEBASED for all Unix and VMS systems, For other systems if you are the

‘first person to try this software, it may be easier to start with FILEBASED.

Make a second copy of the compiled skeleton program with a different name (e.g., player2

_ or player2.exe as appropriate). Simply copying it will work unless you are using

FILEBASED communication and the program name has to be built into the program, in
which case you'll have to recompile with the new name; see the appropriate README and
source files for details.

Edit the ‘players’ file (in the monitor's directory) to specify your two players. See the
comments in the 'players' file and in the "monitor" chapter of the documentation,

Run the monitor, Now a game between your two players should commence. Note thou gh

_ that games with only one buyer or one seller are not representative of the full game; many

strategy issues do not arise.
Play with the following to familiarize yourself with the system:

a. Adding more players. Note that on many systems you can get away with using the
same executable binary player. program more than once in a game (simply specify it
multiple times in the ‘players’ file). This will never work for FILEBASED players
though; these must always have unique names because the *.in and *.out message files
must be unique.

b. Changing the game parameters in the 'game' file.

Double Auction Tournament -22- Participant's Manual
4h

10,

c. Controlling the monitor with single letter runtime commands (see the "monitor" chapter
of the documentation.

d. Sending the monitor listfile output to a file (this gives a different screen display); see the
"monitor" chapter of the documentation.

Compile the human player. See the directions in the README file from the C source. Note
that you need to customize 'define.h' differently for the human player and C skeleton
players. Define the human player in the ‘players’ file, being sure to include the -h flag, as
‘veil as one or more skeleton players. Run the monitor, sending the listfile output to a file.
You should then find yourself playing a game against the skeleton player(s).

To start developing your own strategy, study the "skeleton" chapter of the documentation,
and then look at the appropriate skeleton.* source file and the README file in the source
directory. ,

FOR PC USERS WITH THE SOFTWARE ON FLOPPY DISKS

1.

If you don't have printed documentation, print the appropriate files from the DOC directory
on Disk-2. To start with you'll want at least "intro" and "software."

Copy the root level files on Disk-1 (i.e. all but PASCAL.DIR) to a suitable directory on your
hard disk. Make a subdirectory ‘of that directory for the skeleton programs in the language of
your choice (C, FORTRAN, or PASCAL), and copy the contents of the appropriate directory

on Disk-1 or Disk-2 into it.

As a trial, you can play a simple game, pitting yourself (via the human player interface)
against PLAYER.EXE. Get into the directory with DMON.EXE in it, and type: . -

DMON OUTFILE

A game should begin with you randomly either a buyer or seller. It will be VERY SLOW,
and NOT REPRESENTATIVE of the full game with many players; games with only a single
buyer or a single seller (or both) do not raise most of the strategy issues of a full game. But
it may help to introduce you to the game and the software. Here are some things to try:

a.  Typea?at any prompt.

b, Type 'help' at any prompt. Try some of the commands/options listed there, especially
u, w, and h.

c. Type ‘quit’ when you are tired of playing.
d. After playing, display or print the file OUTFILE, to which the monitor sent its output.

For more information about the human player and its commands and display, look in the
‘players’ chapter of the documentation. For more information about the monitor and its
output (as in OUTFILE) look in the ‘monitor’ chapter of the documentation.

To make things reasonably fast on a PC, we highly recommend creating a RAM disk for the
players. If you do not currently have a RAM disk running on your machine, one can easily
be installed using the VDISK program supplied with later versions of DOS. In your
CONFIG.SYS file (found in the root directory) insert the following line: .

Double Auction Tournament -23- Participant's Manual
DEVICE=CADOS\VDISK.SYS 128

This assumes that your vdisk.sys file is in the CNDOS directory; modify if necessary. The
128 gives you a 128K RAM disk, which should be sufficient for several players and their
message files; increase or decrease as needed. If you have extended memory (beyond 640K)
you can install your RAM disk there by adding /E to the end of the above line.

Reboot your machine after changing CONFIG.SYS; you should now have a RAM disk as
drive D. You can use it just like any other drive except that its contents are lost when you
turn your machine off or reboot.

Copy your players (.EXE files) to your RAM disk, and change your PLAYERS file to reflect
their new location; the directory column should just contain 'D:' (or other appropriate drive
letter) unless you make subdirectories on your RAM disk.

You can also copy the monitor and its associated files to the RAM disk if you make it large
enough, but this will not convey much advantage.

Once you have mastered using a RAM disk for your players, the. process of copying the
appropriate files to it can be automated with batch file.

5. To try a game with more players, make copies of PLAYER.EXE with different names (e.g.,
PLAYER1.EXE etc.), and modify the PLAYERS file appropriately to define the players in
each game. You can try games with or without a human player. If you include a human
player you must direct the monitor's output to a file (e.g., 'DMON OUTFILE); without a
human player you can let the output go to the screen (e.g., 'DMON’). If you don't have a
human player the monitor will respond to several single-letter commands from the terminal;
see the "monitor" chapter of the documentation. :

6. To try a game with graphical display of the supply and demand curves and transaction prices,
use GDMON instead of DMON. See also the discussion of the -g and -p options in the
"monitor" chapter of the documentation,

7. You can also try changing the game parameters in the file GAME,

8. To start developing your own strategy, study the "skeleton" chapter of the documentation,
and then look at the appropriate SKELETON.* source file and the README file in the
source directory. You should try compiling the skeleton without any changes (besides the
customization required—see the README) before developing any new Strategies. The
resulting player program should behave essentially like the PLAYER.EXE provided.

9. There is a considerable advantage to having a small executable player file, since it must be
loaded frequently. You may want to explore ways provided by your compiler to minimize
the .EXE size, including inhibiting some forms of debugging. Some hints are provided in
the README files and makefiles. In general we find that Fortran executables are larger than
C executables, which are larger than Pascal executables. .

2.5 Getting Help

We will try to assist you in getting our software to run on your system if necessary. We request,
however, that you make an effort to thorou ghly understand this documentation before requesting
individual help from us, since many standard questions are already answered in the documentation.
Many standard questions are already answered by the organizers in the "mail" file available by FTP
from pub/dat (see section 1.5 and section 2.3 for details). The organizers are available to answer

This chapter describes the structure of the skeleton programs and the variables defined therein.
The description here is largely language- independent; language-dependent details may be found in
README files and/or as comments in the software provided for each available language.

3.1 Introduction

Skeleton player programs are presently available in C, Fortran, and Pascal. The skeleton programs
take care of all the bookkeeping and communication details, allowing participants to concentrate on
writing the central decision-making routines to implement their strategy. The skeleton programs
provided are actually complete programs with a simple built-in strategy, and may be compiled and
used as test players. To produce their own player programs, participants will modify the skeletons
and re-compile.

A complete player program based on one of the skeleton programs consists of the following parts:

1. The strategy routines, "BID' and 'BUY' for a buyer, or 'OFFER' and 'SELL' for a seller.
_ ‘These routines return a value indicating the user's decision. In the skeleton programs as
supplied these routines contain simple algorithms as examples.

2. Miscellaneous user routines that are called at different stages of the game to provide
information to the user. These are all empty dummy routines in the skeleton programs as
supplied. They do not need to be modified unless users desire to use them to gather
information or initialize or update their own variables.

3. Control routines that take care of bookkeeping, communicating with the monitor, calling the
strategy and miscellaneous routines, saving and restoring variables, displaying the game,
providing random numbers, etc. Participants should not need to change these routines, or
even to understand how they work.

Note that routine names are written in upper-case (e.g., BID) in this document, but may need to be
lower-case in actual programs.

In more detail, the user routines are as follows:

STRATEGY ROUTINES

BID For a buyer, called at the start of each bid-offer step to decide on a bid value, or to
pass.

OFFER For a seller, called at the start of each bid-offer step to decide on an offer value, or
to pass.

BUY For a buyer, called at the start of each buy-sell step to decide whether to request to
buy.

SELL. For a seller, called at the start of each buy-sell step to decide whether to request to
sell.

Note that a player program can play a buyer or a seller, or may be able to play either. If only one
of the roles is chosen, then only two of the four strategy routines needs to be developed.

Double Auction Tournament ~26- Participant's Manual
However, in the tournament, players that can only play one role will be selected for fewer games,
and thus have less opportunity for profit.

More details about the return values of these routines is given in the last section of this document.
MISCELLANEOUS ROUTINES |

GBEGIN Called once at the beginning of each game.

GEND- Called once at the end of each game.

RBEGIN Called at the beginning of each round.

REND _ Called at the end of each round.

PBEGIN Called at the beginning of each period.

PEND Called at the end of each period.
BOEND Called at the end of each bid-offer step, after all players’ bids. and offers have been
processed. —
BSEND Called at the end of each buy-sell step, after all players’ buy and sell requests have
been processed. .

3.2 Variables in the user routines -

The variables and arrays described below are available in all the user routines (strategy routines and.
miscellaneous routines). They provide all the information available to the player, on which
bid/offer/buy/sell decisions must be made. The variable names and meanings are almost the same
in all languages, and are defined here in a language-independent way. See the comments in the

appropriate skeleton programs for all language-dependent details.

None of the variables described should be altered by the user routines themselves; doing so will
not have any useful effect.

All variables are integers. Prices are represented by integers in the range 1—8000. It is of no
consequence whether these values are regarded as dollars, cents, or some other unit.

Some variables are one-dimensional arrays of fixed length. The length is given in square brackets.
Thus, for example, token[4] represents a 4-element array. How this is declared and referenced is
language-dependent. In general array indices or subscripts run upwards from 1, not from 0.

It is convenient to divide the variables into three classes, according to whether they are public (the

same for all players) or private, and whether they are constant or varying:

PUBLIC CONSTANTS

These variables are unchanging throughout a game (the same in all periods and steps), and are
known to all players:

nplayers The total number of players in the game, including yourself.

nbuyers The number of buyers in the game. This will never exceed 20.

Double Auction Tournament -27- Participant's Manual
nsellers The number of sellers in the game. This will never exceed 20. Note that
nbuyers+nsellers = nplayers.

bnumber[20] A player-number for each buyer, in the range 1—9999. There is one entry for
each buyer, 1 to nbuyers, and the remaining entries are zero. These numbers
are intended to give a unique identification to each program and participant
across all games, so that participants in the pre-tournament Santa Fe Token
Exchange games can determine who they have and have not played against. A
directory will be available. A value of 9999 is used to mean a human player.
Some values may be Teported as 0 to mean anonymous; all players will be
anonymous in the actual tournament. Do not confuse player-numbers with the
player id's (described below) that are used to identify the players in a particular
game.

snumber[20] A player-number for each seller. Like bnumber{20].

nrounds The maximum number of rounds in the game. This will never exceed 20.
nperiods The maximum number of periods per round. This will never exceed 5.
ntimes The number of time units in each period. This will never exceed 400, At each

time there is first a bid-offer step and then a buy-sell step. A period will not be
terminated before all 'ntimes'’ time units have been played if it is possible for
any pair of players to trade with mutual profit. Early termination will rot
necessarily occur even when no more mutual profit is possible; see the
description of the monitor's ‘deadsteps' parameter.

minprice The minimum price value allowed for any bid or offer.

maxprice The maximum price value allowed for any bid or offer. Note that 1 <= minprice
= maxprice <= 8000. oo .

gameid An arbitrary unique integer in the range 1 - 9999 that identifies this particular
game. The gameid is useful for referring to particular games and for creating
unique filenames, etc. It will normally increase from game to game.

gametype A 4 (decimal) digit number conveying the values for RANI,..., RAN4, The
RAN() values govern the raridom generation of tokens as described in rule 25
of chapter 7. The RAN(i) values are ‘given by

RANG) =3k@~1  j=1,..,.4

where k(i) is the i'th digit of gametype, counting from the left), and where 3k(i) denotes 3 to the
power k(i). Thus, for example, gametype = 1236 means

RANI =31-1=2
RAN2 = 32-1=8
RAN3 = 33 - 1 =28
RAN4 = 36. 1 = 728

The values for the digits k(i) are restricted to (0,1,...,8). Values of gametype less than 1000 are

taken as having leading zeroes. gametype = 0 implies that the token generation method is not
revealed,

Double Auction Tournament -28- Participant's Manual
The upper limits on nbuyers, nsellers, nrounds, nperiods, and ntimes specified above may be
relevant if you want to construct your own arrays to record historical or strategic information about
other players or the game so far. In fact the upper limits will rarely be approached, and you can set
lower limits of your own if necessary; see the skeleton programs for details. If the parameters of a
particular game exceed your own limits, your program will automatically refuse to play in it. Note
also that no token value is allowed to exceed 8000 (due to technicalities of the software design). If
the RAN(i) values are set sufficiently high, this limitation will cause an upward truncation in the
token distribution at 8000. However rule 25 in chapter 7 guarantees that in the tournament RAN()
values will be chosen so that such truncation will never occur.

PUBLIC VARIABLES

These variables change with the progress of the game and are known to all players. All are set to 0
before the start of the game and (except r and p) before the start of each new period (i.e. before the
call to PBEGIN). The “unknown” values referred to below can only occur if a player makes a

‘late’ response (sée ‘late’ below). , 7

r The number of the current round, r= 1, 2, ..., nrounds, \

p The number of the current period within the current round, p = 1, 2, ..., nperiods.
t - The current time within the current period, t=1, 2, ..., ntimes. .

cbid The current bid value if any, or zero if none. In a SELL routine this is the value

you accept in a sell request. In a BID routine this is the value to beat; a new bid
must be above this value. Ina bid-offer step the highest bid (Gif any) determines the
new cbid value before the call to BOEND: The current bid is removed (cbid=0)
whenever a trade occurs, before the callto BSEND.  —-——s’ , ,

coffer The current offer value if any, or zero if none. In a BUY routine this is the value
- you accept in a buy request. In an OFFER routine this is the value to. beat; a new
offer must be below this value. In a bid-offer step the. lowest offer (if any)
determines the new coffer value before the call to BOEND. The current offer is

removed (coffer=0) whenever a trade occurs, before the call to BSEND.

bidder The id of the holder of the current bid, or zero if none. Between 1 and nbuyers
when cbid>0, always 0 when cbid=0.

offerer The id of the holder of the current offer, or zero if none. Between 1 and nsellers
when coffer>0, always 0 when coffer=0.

nbids The number of new bids made by buyers in the last bid-offer step, or 0 if none or
unknown. Updated before each BOEND call.

noffers The number of new offers made by sellers in the last bid-offer step, or 0 if none or
unknown. Updated before each BOEND call.

bids[20] The actual bids made by each buyer in the last bid-offer step, or zero if none or
unknown, There is one entry for each buyer, 1 to nbuyers, and the remaining
entries are zero. The whole array is reset to reflect the new bids before-each
BOEND call.

offers[20] The actual offers made by each seller in the last bid-offer step, or zero if none or
- unknown. There is one entry for each seller, 1 to nsellers, and the remaining

entries are zero. The whole array is reset to reflect the new bids before each
BOEND call.

A code telling what happened in the last buy-sell step: 0 if no trade occurred, 1 if a

buy request was accepted, 2 if a sell request was accepted, -1 if unknown because

of a ‘late' condition. This is set before each BSEND call. The next three variables
provide more detail about the transaction if bstype>0. They are set at the same time
as bstype. They are all set to zero if bstype<=0.

The price of the transaction.

The id of the buyer involved in the transaction. If bstype=1 this is a buyer whose
‘buy' request was accepted. If bstype=2 this is the buyer whose current bid was
accepted by ‘seller’: so

The id of the seller involved in the transaction. If bstype=2 this is a seller whose
‘sell’ request was accepted. If bstype=1 this is the seller whose current offer was
accepted by ‘buyer’.

A summary array giving the number of trades that each. buyer has made so far in
this period. There is one entry for each buyer, 1 to nbuyers, and the remaining
entries are zero. A trade for a buyer is an accepted buy request or the acceptance by
a seller of that buyer's current bid; in either case one token is consumed. Updated

A summary array giving the number of trades that each seller has made so far in this
period. There is one entry for each seller, 1 to nsellers, and the remaining entries
are zero. A trade fora seller is an accepted sell request or the acceptance by a
buyer of that seller's current offer; in either case one token is consumed. Updated
beforeeachcalltoBSEND, = «©

The total number of trades made by all players so far in this period.

The price of every trade that has occurred so far in this period. There is one entry
for each trade, 1 to ntrades, and the remaining entries are zero. The value is
negative (multiplied by -1) if the trade was made by you.

The time (value of t) at which the most recent trade occurred in this period, or 0 if
no trade has occurred yet in this period.

PRIVATE VARIABLES

Most of these variables change with the progress or the game and are in general different for each
player. All are set to 0 before the start of the game. mytrades, mylasttime, pprofit, nobidoff, bo,
nobuysell, bs, and late are reset to 0 at the start of every period and round. In addition at the start
of each round, rprofit, tradelist[5], and profitlist[5] are reset to zero, and ntokens and tokens[4] are
set to their new values.

id

role

Your own identification number, between 1 and nbuyers if you are a buyer, and
between 1 and nsellers if you are a seller. When the id number of another player is
given, it is always clear from context whether it is that of a buyer or that of a seller.

1 if you are a buyer, 2 if you are a seller.

The number of seconds of elapsed (wall) time that you have per step. 9999 implies
infinity; the monitor will wait for ever. 0 means a relatively short time, normally
used for pipe-based players, that depends on the monitor's ‘timefactors'
parameters.

The number of tokens that you have available to buy or sell. This is fixed for a
given round, but may change from round to round. It will never exceed 4, and in
the tournament it will be the same for all players. -

The redemption values of your tokens, in token[1], ..., token[ntokens]. The
redemption values are given in decreasing order for a buyer and in increasing order
for a seller, and are assumed to be used in that order, which maximizes any profits.
Any unused array elements are set to 0.

The number of trades (0 - ntokens) that you have made so far in this period. This is
equal to the appropriate entry in btrades or strades. If mytrades<ntokens your next
available token value is token[mytrades+1]. If mytrades=ntokens you have used all
your tokens and cannot make any further bid, offer, buy, or sell requests.

The time (value of t) at which your most recent trade occurred in this period, or 0 if
you have not yet made any trades in this period.

Your total profit so far in this period of the game, or 0 if you have not yet made any
trades in this period.

Your total profit so far in this round of the game, or Oif you have not yet made any
trades in this round. :

Your total profit so far in this game, or 0 if you have not yet made any trades.

0 if you are allowed to make a bid or offer, 1 if you can't because you have no
tokens left. -1 if unknown because of a 'late' condition. Reset before each call to
BID or OFFER. :

A code that tells you the outcome of your request in the last bid-offer step. This is
updated before each call to BOEND. The meaning of the codes is as follows:

0 You didn't make a bid or offer, and you don't still hold the current one.

1 You didn't make a bid or offer, but your previous bid or offer is still the
current one,

2. Your bid or offer was chosen and is now the current one.
3 Your bid or offer was bettered by another player.

4 Your bid or offer was equal to that of at least one other player, and you lost
the random tie-break.

-1 Your bid or offer was unacceptable. This could be because it was outside the
allowed range (minprice to maxprice), or because it was a bid that wasn't
above the current bid, or an offer that wasn't below the current offer, or
because you have no tokens left to trade.

Double Auction Tournament -31- Participant's Manual
nobuysell

bs

late

-2_ A previous response to a bid-offer or buy-sell step was late and was ignored.
See ‘late’ below.

Note that your new bid or offer is reported to the other players in cases 2-4, but not
in case -1 or -2.

0 if you are allowed'to make a buy or sell request, non-zero if not. -1 if unknown
because of a ‘late’ condition. This is reset before each call to BUY or SELL.
When non-zero the value is between 1 and 7, given by the sum of whichever of the
following apply: ,

1 No tokens left to trade.

2  Nocurrent offez/bid to accept.

4 You don't hold the current bid or offer.

A code that tells you the outcome of your request in the last buy-sell step. This is
reset after each buy-sell step. The meaning of the codes is as follows:

Q You didn't make a buy or sell request.

1 ~=Your buy or sell request was accepted and you made a trade.

2 Your buy or sell request was rejected because both the current bidder and the

current offerer asked to buy/sell, and you lost the random tie break (losing is
usually better than winning here).

3 Your buy or sell request was rejected because another buyer or seller (the
same type as you) also made a valid request, and won the random tie-break.

-1 Your buy or sell request was unacceptable. This could be because there was
no corresponding current offer or bid, or because you had no tokens left to
trade, or because you didn't hold the current bid or offer, This should not
occur if you never try to buy or sell when nobuysell is non-zero.

-2 Aprevious response to a bid-offer or buy-sell step was late and was ignored.
See ‘late’ below.

Note that only successful buy/sell requests (bs=1) are reported to the other players.

Note also that you may have made a trade even if bs is not equal to 1, because your
current bid or offer may have been accepted by another player. Check whether
‘buyer’ or 'seller' (as appropriate) is equal to your ‘id' to know for sure.

The number of times in this period that you were late and failed to respond on time.
If this is non-zero, be aware that the following variables may be incorrect in this
period, even long after the late response, because information from the monitor may
have been missed: btrades[20], strades[20], ntrades, prices, lasttime, mylasttime,
pprofit. The following variables may be incorrect in this period and/or in future
periods if you were ever late: rprofit, gprofit, profitlist[5], efficiency. The
following variables may be temporarily incorrect, while either bo or bs is set to -2,
but should recover correctly: nbids, noffers,‘bids[20], offers[20], bstype, price,

Double Auction Tournament -32- Participant's Manual
buyer, seller, nobidoff, nobuysell, t. Except for t this last group is set to well
defined "unknown" values when a correct value is not known because of a late
response; see the entries for the individual variables above. t may temporarily be
smaller than its true value after a late response. .

tradelist[5] The number of trades you made in each period of this round. There is one entry for
each period, 1 to p, started so far in this round, and the remaining entries are 0.
Updated after each trade.

profitlist[5] The profit you made in each period of this round. There is one entry for each
period, 1 to p, started so far in this round, and the remaining entries are 0. Updated
after each trade.

efficiency A measure of your overall performance in this game, available only in the GEND
routine at the end of the game. The measure is a ratio (times 100) of your actual
profit to your expected profit predicted by economic theory (computed at the
midpoint competitive equilibrium price). 100 is average, higher values are better.

3.3 Working variables

If file-based communication is in use, each player program must be reloaded for each step, and all
needed variables must be saved to a disk file and restored from it. The control routines do this
automatically for all the variables discussed above, and can also save specified variables of your
own. How this is done is language dependent; see the comments in the README file and skeleton
programs for your chosen language.

If pipe-based or internet-based communication is used, the player programs are continuously
loaded during a game, and the save/restore mechanism is not needed. You may create new
variables as you please (including global or common ones), and expect them to retain their values
according to the usual conventions of the language used.

Player programs may also create and use external files of their own; each player program will
normally exist in its own sub-directory. Such files will be preserved from game to game.

3.4 Return values

In a BID or OFFER routine you must specify a bid or offer value, or none, Ina BUY or SELL
routine you must say if you want to buy or sell. The way that these return values from your
strategy routines are passed back to the control routines is language-dependent. For details see the
comments in the skeleton program for your language. Here we simply define the values
concerned, All values are integers.

BID (buyer only) For a BID routine, return the value of the bid if you want to make
one, or 0 if you don't. If you do make a bid it must be between minprice and
maxprice inclusive, and must be higher than the current bid ‘cbid' if there is one.
You must return 0 if nobidoff is non-zero.

OFFER (seller only) For an OFFER routine, return the value of the offer if you want to
make one, or 0 if you don't. If you do make an offer it must be between minprice
and maxprice inclusive, and must be lower than the current offer ‘coffer’ if there is
one. You must return 0 if nobidoff is non-zero.

Double Auction Tournament -33- Participant's Manual
BUY

SELL

(buyer only) For a BUY routine, return 1 if you want to request a buy at the
current offer price 'coffer', or 0 if you don't. You must return 0 if nobuysell is
non-zero.

(seller only) For a sell routine, return 1 if you want to request a sell at the current
bid price ‘cbid’, or 0 if you don't. You must return 0 if nobuysell is non-zero.

CHAPTER 4: THE MONITOR

This chapter explains how to use the monitor, and how to interpret its output. The latter is useful
not only to participants running a local monitor, but also to those using the Santa Fe Token
Exchange (SFTE); the SFTE monitor mails its main (listfile) output back to each participant.
Instructions for compiling the monitor are not given here; see the README file in the monitor
source directory.

4.1 Starting the monitor

On an IBM PC two executable versions of the monitor are provided, called 'dmon' and 'gdmon’.
The difference is that 'gdmon' has graphics built in, and turned on by default. ‘dmon' is smaller
and has no graphics capability. On other computers without graphics capability the monitor is
normally called ‘dmon’.

Before running the monitor you must set up the game file and players file in the same directory as
the monitor. The versions provided, called 'game' and ‘players’ respectively, contain comments
that document the format of these files, and some example entries.

The game file specifies the basic parameters for the game, including the number of rounds and
periods etc, token generation parameters, and timing parameters. See the supplied ‘game’ file for
details.

The players file specifies all local players (network players are controlled by parameters in the
game file, if you have the full networking software). Each local player is specified by a directory
name and a file name. The directory specification is relative to the monitor's own directory, so for
example a directory ‘playdir' means subdirectory playdir of the monitor's directory. It is
recommended (for speed) that all players either be in such immediate subdirectories or be in the

monitor's own directory, but other directory specifications (and, for the PC, drive specifications)
‘are allowed. Examples are given in the supplied 'nlayers' file. Note that all file-based players must

have distinct pathnames, whereas pipe-based players may be specified more than once on Unix
systems,

Each player may also be given one or more option flags in the players file. It is crucial that these be
assigned correctly. See the description and examples in the supplied ‘players’ file.

Once the game file and players file are set up correctly, the monitor may be started with a command
of the form

dmon [options] { listfile [ logfile [ gamefile [ playerfile ]]}]

It is essential that the current directory is set to the monitor's directory; starting the monitor from
another directory will NOT work.

Double Auction Tournament -35- Participant's Manual
The options will be discussed later. The four optional file names have the followin g meanings and
defaults: |

listfile Main output listing of the game. Defaults to stdout.

logfile Initial setup report and error messages. Defaults to stdout.

gamefile File specifying game parameters. Defaults to ‘game’.

playerfile File specifying local players. Defaults to ‘players’.

Any of these filenames may be specified as - to mean the default, A + preceding logfile (e.g.,
"+log") implies append to the end, logfile may be specified as = to mean the same as listfile. If

listfile or logfile contain any #'s they will be replaced by digits of the game number. E.g., out#
becomes out284 for game 284 (or 1284).

Examples (for game 538):

dmon everything goes to stdout

dmon out#H## main report to out538, log to stdout

dmon out log##H# main report to out538, log to 10og538
dmon out### +dmonlog main to out538, log appended to dmonlog
dmon out###= everything to out538

dmon - - newgame dummies everything to stdout: game and players files
specified as 'newgame' and ‘dummies’

Output redirection with > is not recommended for the monitor output. The monitor tries to write

sensible things to its listfile and logfile depending on whether or not they go to files, and whether
or not they go the same place; using redirection prevents this.

Double Auction Tournament -36- Participant's Manual
tins

wrest

The following options may be specified:

Turns off terminal input. MUST be used to run the monitor in background/batch.

Turns on all graphics, if available. Currently only available on the PC. This is the
default for 'gdmon’.

Restricts graphics to display only the supply and demand curves at the start of each
round.

Restricts: graphics to display only the transaction data (with supply and demand
curves) at end of each period.

"Makes graphics automatic—it displays whatever you selected with the above options

without asking you first.

Turns off graphics if on by default. Note: -g options may be concatenated. E.g., - -
g2a

Specifies PC directory where the .BGI and .CHR graphics files are located. E.g., -
prtc2. The default for the precompiled versions of the monitor is \tc. If the files are
not found in the specified or default directory, they are. searched for in the monitor's
own directory. Note that the .BGI and .CHR files are provided on the floppy disk
with dmon, but you probably already have copies on your hard disk if you have

_Turbo-C.

Example with options:

- dmon -b out##### +log &

(The & is a Unix special character that makes the job run in the background.)

4.2 Runtime commands

If no player uses the terminal (no -t or -h flag in the players file), and there is no -b flag on the
dmon command line, the following single-letter commands are available while the monitor is

running:

A. While waiting for network players (inet version only):

NS]

start the game now
aorg abort the game

B. During the main game:

t

Pp

make this the last time step of this period (after next BS step).
make this the last period of this round.

make this the last round of the game.

end the game; equivalent to 'rpt’.

quit; like 'e', but suppresses mailback and any final graphic display.

Double Auction Tournament -37- Participant's Manual
k kill any players we're waiting for now.
c continue; force the next step now (may mark some players as late).

These commands do not echo and take effect immediately (though output may be backlogged,
making an apparent delay). Any other character rings the bell. Use 'k' only when the monitor is
stuck waiting for a player who is not responding,

4.3 VAX/VMS Notes

The monitor should work correctly on a VAX/VMS system. The treatment of file-based players is
straightforward and should cause no problem, but may be very slow on a busy system. Pipe-
based players are much more efficient, and thus faster, but more fragile. Each pipe-based player is
started up as a sub-process of the monitor, and-communicates with it via VMS "mailboxes." If
something goes wrong it is possible for the player subprocess to continue running (in a wait state)
even after the monitor exits or aborts. You can check for subprocesses with the command
"SHOW PROCESS/SUB"—the player sub-processes are called PLAYERI, PLAYER2, etc. If
you see any of these in the process tree, you can kill them with "STOP PLAYERn." The monitor
will refuse to run a player if its chosen sub-process name already exists.

Note that you must have the TMPMBX -and NETMBX process privileges, and a non-zero
subprocess quota, to run the monitor. Most users will have these.

Be patient when starting a game. VAX/VMS takes a relatively long time to start up a subprocess
when the system is busy.

4.4 Explanation of Monitor "Listfile" Output

The main output of the monitor is a concise summary of the game parameters, the players
involved, and the actual play of the game. It is produced in the "listfile" output of the monitor,
which defaults to stdout. In network games run at the Santa Fe Token Exchange, the listfile output
is automatically e-mailed back to participants after successful game completion. °

PARAMETER SECTION

The first section of the listfile output gives the parameters used in the game. For example:

stokens: 50 150 225 275

timefactors: 1000 500 500 500 500 500 250

The heading gives the game number (gameid) and the date and time that the game began.

Double Auction Tournament -38- Participant's Manual
The ‘files:’ line gives the names of the files used for the listfile, logfile, gamefile, and playerfile, in
that order. See the monitor's README file for details. The - in the above example means that the
logfile output was sent to stdout.

‘protocol’ and ‘monitor’ give the version numbers of the message-passing protocol and monitor
program respectively. They can normally be ignored.

The remaining parameter values are all specified in the gamefile. They are explained by comments
in the distributed version of this file, called ‘game’.

The internet version of the monitor (as used at the Santa Fe Token Exchange) adds several more
parameters to the above list. The additional parameters are all concerned with controlling the
waiting period for players, and the maximum and minimum number of players required for a
game. They should not be important unless you have the internet version of the monitor, in which
case you will find an explanation in the extended version of the 'game’ file.

PLAYER SECTION

The second section of the listfile output lists the players involved in the game. For example:

id © num ‘flags location name/comment
Bl 500 =p playdir/qp Pipe C skeleton
B2 9999 isH palmer@physics sphy.duke.edu Richard Palmer.
Si 502—s ip fortran/pplayer Fortran skeleton
$2 501 f playdir/gf File C skeleton

2 buyers, 2 sellers

The ‘id’ column gives the name used for each player, starting with B for buyers and S for sellers.

“The 'num' column gives the player-number of each player; this should uniquely identify the player
“and the strategy. Participants are assigned a range of values to use. 9999 is used for human

players. 0 means that a correct value is unknown or has not been assigned; patticipants should ask

.

for a correct assignment rather than using 0 except temporarily.

The ‘flags’ show various status flags for each player. Most of these are specified or implied by the
player descriptions in the playerfile; see the comments in the distributed version of this file called
‘players’. The first column of flags describes the communication method, and may be f (file-
based), p (pipe-based), a (pipe-based. with descriptors passed in the argument string), or i
(internet-based). The second column describes the timing option, and may be s (slow), w (wait),
or blank (default). The third column describes the player/connection/output type, and may be
blank (default), t (player requires terminal), h (human player), H (human player via internet), d
(connected via DAND), or c (C-player via internet).

The ‘location’ gives the directory and filename (relative to the monitor's directory) for a local
player, or the internet address of a network player. The internet address is not necessarily that at
which the player is located, but is normally a suitable mailing address for the player. A numerical
address enclosed in square brackets (e.g., fred@[192.12.12.2]) may be used with most mailers.
An address or comment appearing in parentheses (¢.g., joe@ (local)) is NOT suitable for e-mail.

The 'name/comment' column gives the comments from the playerfile for local players, and the

player or program name for network players. DANI and the human network interface both ask the
player for his/her name, while the C internet-based player has a player name built into the program.

Double Auction Tournament -39- Participant's Manual
GAME SECTION—TOKEN DISTRIBUTION

The main game report consists of token-distribution headings, step-by-step lines, and summaries.
The token-distribution headings appear at the start of each period. For example:

Round 1, Period [
token| Bi B2 S1 82 Equilibrium
a 816+ 816+ 429+ = 427+ 641 to 650
b 762+ 765+ 553+ = 553+ av: 645.5
Cc 658+ 661+ 641+ 640+ trades: 6
d 555- _553- | 650 653—

The tokens assigned to each player are labeled a, b, etc., with values as given in the table. Each
value has a + or a - appended to it, depending on whether (+) or not (-) it would be traded if all
trades occurred at the theoretical average equilibrium price. An = is used if the token value is equal
to the average equilibrium price.

The ‘Equilibrium’ column shows the equilibrium price range and its average. There is often a
finite range because the supply and demand curves usually have a vertical segment in common,
The number of trades expected in equilibrium is also shown; this is normally equal to the number
of + suffixes in both the buyer and the seller columns. “no crossing*’ appears below ‘trades’ if
the supply and demand curves do not cross.

GAME SECTION—STEP-BY-STEP LINES

Each bid-offer and buy-sell Step is summarized on a line. For example:

t_step | Bl B2 Si S2 cbid _coff price
1 BO 470* 469 | 717* 722 | 476717

BS co 476. . 717
2 BO 549* 541 | 644* 645 | 549 644 ;

BS | a<A <A 644
3 BO 476* 469 | 717* 729 476 717

BS © 476 717
4 BO 549 550*| 667 654* | 550 654

BS | - 550 . 654
5 BO S81 585*| 623 623* | 585 623

BS a<A a<A 623
29 BO 639% 644* D 639 644

BS D 639 644

BS D 641 642
31 BO 642* " D 642 642=

BS coc coC 6D 642

The leftmost columns show the time t and whether the step is a bid-offer (BO) or buy-sell (BS)
step. The rightmost columns show the current bid and current offer, if any, at the conclusion of
each step, and the price of any transaction that occurred. An = sign or ! sign follows the current
offer column if the current bid is equal to (=) or greater than (!) the current offer.

Double Auction Tournament -40- Participant's Manual

a]
cz]

For bid-offer steps the central columns show the bids and offers made by each player. The current
(highest) bid and current (lowest) offer are indicated by a * suffix. If there are no new Current bids
but one is left over from the previous bid-offer step it is shown by a double quote ("), and similarly
for offers.

For buy-sell steps the central columns indicate requests to buy or sell by lower-case letters, and
actual tokens sold by upper-case letters. The letter used identifies the token concerned. The
direction of a transaction is indicated by the < or > symbols, which point like arrows from the
accepted bid or offer to the acceptor; < means a buy request. was accepted and > means a sell
request was accepted. Thus for example in step 5 BS, both B2 and $2 made buy/sell requests and
B2 ‘won' the random 50-50 tie break, so a ‘buy’ trade was executed at the current offer price.
Note that it is in fact better to ‘lose’ such a random tie break unless the current bid is greater than or
equal to the current offer.

Several other symbols may appear in the central columns in either bid-offer or buy-sell steps:

D means that the player is ‘dead’, for one of many reasons. Death is irreversible. The D
symbol may also appear in the summaries described in the next section. ,

X means that the player's response was unacceptable, such as a bid below the current bid, or a
buy request when there is no current offer.

N means that the player is non-responsive—no reply was received for this step.

L _ means that.the player made a ‘late’ response, presumably to a previous step. A response is
marked as late, and otherwise ignored, following any non-responsive (N) step.

? means that the response was invalid or unrecognized.

Note that the above symbols marking abnormal situations may be combined with some of the

normal symbols, For example D" could occur in a bid-offer step if the holder of the current offer

~ died and no other offer was made, and could be followed by D<B if a buyer subsequently accepted

this offer, thus buying the ‘dead’ player's second (B) token.

A line is drawn across the output when no further mutual profit is possible. If the ‘deadsteps'
parameter is set to 0 this will cause the period to be ended, but if deadsteps > 0 further steps may
appear after the line.

GAME SECTION—SUMMARIES

Summaries appear at the end of every period, and at the end of every round, and at the end of the
game. The three types have basically the same appearance but apply to the preceding period,
round, or game respectively. For example:

Round 1, summary

Bl B2 Sl $2
Market
Trades 6/6 6/6 7/6 5/6 24/24
Profit 667 697 559 532 2455

Eqlbrm 599 611 627 532 2470
Effncy 111% 114% 89% 84% 99%

Double Auction Tournament ~41- Participant's Manual
The 'Trades' row shows the number of trades made by each player, out of the number predicted if
all trades occurred at the theoretical equilibrium prices, The final 'Market' column shows the same
information for the whole market (buyers plus sellers).

The 'Profit' row shows the actual profits made. The ‘Eqlbrm' row shows the profits predicted if
all trades occurred at the theoretical equilibrium prices. A .following an Eqlbrm value means 0.5
(e.g., 585. would mean 985.5).

The 'Effncy' row shows the 'Profit' row as a percentage of the 'Eqlbrm' row. The 'Effncy' may
be shown as 0/0 (if Profit and Eqlbrm are both 0), or as ‘inf’ (if Eqlbrm is 0 but Profit is not), or
as ‘huge' (if greater than 9999%).

45 Explanation of Monitor "Logfile" Output

The monitor's "logfile" output is used to display the startup phase of the gamne, and to display error
messages. It may be sent to the same file as the listfile output (in which case error messages are
interpolated into the game report), or to a different file. Depending on whether the files are the
same or different, and whether the output is to a named file or to stdout (the default), the logfile
output also shows more or less information on the progress of the game.

STARTUP PHASE

During the startup phase the logfile shows one line for each player that the monitor tries to start,
For example:

dat@192.12.12.1: _ connected—S1 C skeleton player
palmer@ 192.12.12.1: connected—B1 Richard Palmer

fortran/fplayer: verified—S2 _
playdir/refuser: started—B2
fortran/pplayer: started—S3

playdir/pq: non-existent or non-readable
playdir/gf: . - verified——B3

This example shows that two network players connected, and then the monitor tried to start five
local players, though one of these (playdir/pq) didn’t actually exist. The numerical address given
for the network players is the actual internet address from which they connected. For the local
players ‘started’ implies that a pipe-based player was successfully started, while 'verified' implies
that a file-based player was checked for existence and accessibility. Players are tentatively

assigned identification numbers (S1, B1, etc), though they may be renumbered later.

At a second stage of the startup phase players are told the game parameters and asked if they want
to play. Any refusals produce messages in the logfile such as:

B2 refused to play © —nrounds unacceptable
— maxtokens unacceptable

This will then cause renumbering of the remaining players before the main listin g of players that
appears in the listfile,

Double Auction Tournament -42- Participant's Manual

ERROR MESSAGES
Error messages from the monitor are intended to be self-explanatory. Some typical ones are:

4 error reading ‘ntimes' from ‘game’: non-digit found
** error reading ‘ntokens’ from ‘game’: value too large
** S$] died in INIT2 0 0 O—fatal error
** B1 died in BIDOFF 1 1 1—quit
** $2 died in BUYSELL 1 2 8—connection broken

" ** BQ died in BIDOFF 2 2 1—killed by operator
** no active buyers left—game ended

Many of the messages show the step in which the error occurred, such as the "BUYSELL 1 2 8’
above, which means the buy-sell step at time 8 of period 2 of round 1. There are many possible
reasons for a player dying, and the difference between reasons like 'read error’, ‘connection
broken’, ‘write error’ and ‘unresponsive’ should only concern an expert, in each case the player
program stopped responding properly. The reason ‘fatal error’ means that the player program
itself detected an error and called the ‘error’ subroutine. An interrupt can also cause this error.
The reason ‘quit’ means that the player intentionally quit the game; this is normally only used by
the human interface. ;

LOG INFORMATION :

If the logfile and listfile are not identical, the logfile shows the progress of the game as it runs.
More information is shown if the logfile is defaulted to stdout than if it is sent to a named file. In
the stdout case an example is:

DA game 1745 _Mon Jun_5 17:06:22. 1989

files: out1745 - game players
Initialization-1
Initialization-2
Round 1

Round 2

period 1
Be CAS ER I CII I I IA IE CR EH TS

period 2
Pe aa aa a

End of game 1745—output is in out1745

The heading and ‘files:’ line are identical to those in the listfile. The ‘Initialization’, ‘Round’, and
'period' lines log the major divisions of the game.

The lines with asterisks are produced one symbol at a time if output is to stdout. One symbol is
shown for each bid-offer and each buy-sell step. For a bid-offer step a * is shown if there were
any bids or offers; otherwise a. is shown. For a buy-sell step a < is shown for a buy transaction,
a > is shown for a Sell transaction, and a - is shown if no transaction occurred. A lis shown when
no more mutual profit can be made.

Double Auction Tournament -43- Participant's Manual
CHAPTER 5; THE PLAYER PROGRAMS

This chapter explains how to use the player programs, including the human interface. Compilation
instructions are not included here; see the appropriate README files and makefiles,

5.1 Starting the Player Programs
INTERNET-BASED PLAYERS

To start an internet-based player (including a human/internet player), simply run the program.
There are no options or arguments (unless you have the full networking software, in which case a
hostname may be specified as an argument). The human/internet player will ask for your name
(maximum 30 characters) and whether you want to be a buyer or a seller. If the program
successfully connects to the monitor you will then receive one of four types of message from the
monitor:

1. A description of the game schedule in a box of *'s, followed by the time at the monitor's
location. This means that no game is presently starting; try again at the appropriate time.

2. A "Waiting for ..." message. This means that a game will start as soon as the condition is
satisfied. Further waiting messages will be sent every 30 seconds until the game starts or
is abandoned.

3, A "Game starting" message. This means that your connection satisfied the condition for a
game, which is now starting.

4. + A'Sorry, .." message. This means that a game is about to start, but that you cannot join it
for the reason given. ° ,

Note that all messages before the beginning of the game itself are sent to stderr, not stdout. This
implies for example that the messages will come to the screen even if you redirect the main (stdout)
output to a file, as may be appropriate for a game run in background. If you start up several
players, with all but one in background, you will see multiple copies of the messages, one from
each player. oo

It may be useful on a Unix system to copy the main (stdout) output to a file as well as sending it to
the screen. Pipe the output into 'tee' to do this. E.g.,:

di | tee output

Here 'di' is the name of the internet player, and ‘output’ is the name of the output file.

. PIPE-BASED OR FILE-BASED PLAYERS

You do not normally run pipe-based or file-based player programs by themselves, but expect the
monitor to do so. The "monitor" chapter of the documentation explains how this is done.

The human interface is used like the machine players except for the following: |
a. The -h flag is required in the playerfile.
b. The monitor's listfile output must be sent to a file, not the screen. Specify the filename on

the command line. E.g., "dmon outfile."

Double Auction Tournament -44- Participant's Manual
Using the human player via DANI is not recommended. Instead make an inetbased version of the
human player itself (with DISPLAY turned on in define.h). If you DO use a human player via
DANI, you must use the -a and -q flags if pipebased (-f and -q if filebased).

If in doubt as to whether the players are working correctly it may be useful to run them directly. A
useful test is to send the player the 15 character message ...31.1234....0 (where each . represents
one space); the response should be ...31.1234 (possibly with one extra leading space). For the
pipe- based case the messages are simply sent to and from stdin and stdout. For the file-based case
the messages must come from the file xxxx.in and are sent to xxxx.out, where xxxx is the player
program's name. After performing this test in the pipe-based case you must abort the player
program, or send it a nonsense message to make it abort.

5,2 Explanation of human player and C-player output

The skeleton players written in C can optionally display the game as it progresses. This is a
compile-time option (see the README file and comments in the programs), and is mainly intended
for use in the human player. It may also be useful with machine players, especially with internet-
based communication. Note that using DANI is an alternative in this case however, and has a
more compact output format. The only difference between the output of the human player and of a
C-player with output display is the prompts and responses used with the human player. These are
discussed separately below.

The output display consists of initial headings, the detailed play of the game, and various
summaries.

INITIAL HEADINGS

The first part of the output gives basic game parameters and a list of player numbers. For example:

DA game 1760 Tue Jun 6 21:32:20 1989

nrounds: 2 nperiods: 2 | ntimes: 50 price range: 1-1000
2 buyers: Bl. 501 B2 9999

2 sellers: S1 502 $2 0

You are seller $1, otherwise known as YOU

The parameters and game-id (1760 in the example) should be self-explanatory. Note that the date
and time is local to the player's location, which may be in a different time-zone than that of the
monitor itself.

The lists of buyers and sellers give their player numbers, or 0 if unknown or anonymous. These

numbers may be useful in identifying strategies you have and have not played against. 9999 is
used for a human player. ‘

Doubie Auction Tournament -45- Participant's Manual
MAIN GAME

The main game is displayed step by step. The format is less concise than DANT's, and takes 6
lines per time step. For example, showing three time steps:

--- round 1 - period 2 time 6 -------------

cbid: (none) coffer: (none) tokens: 542 450 303 264
Biff YOU/ Si/b S2/b

bettered 183* 173 378* 395

~ no trade

--- round ] ------------------ period 2 ---- time 7 -------------

cbid: 183/B1 coffer: 378/S1 tokens: 542 450 303 264
Bl/fe YOU/a Si/b S§2/b

winner 218 247* 330* 333

profit: 212 < 30<

--- round 1 period 2 - time 8 -------------

cbid: (mone) coffer: (none) — - tokens: — 450 303 264

‘Bie YOU/b Si/c S2/b
lost tie ' 183* 183 392 383*
no trade

‘The first line at each time gives the round, period, and time.

The second line gives the current bid and offer, if any, and the player's tokens. Note that the
owners of the current bid and offer are given if applicable. Note also that tokens that have been
traded are replaced by dashes (-).

The third line lists the player names (with "YOU" for the present player), with a lower-case letter
showing which token they will trade next (a = first, b = second, etc.).

The fourth line shows the bids and offers in the bid-offer step, with’an asterisk marking. the current
bid and current offer. A current bid or offer carried over from the previous stép ¢in the absence of
any new ones) would be shown with a # instead of a *. On the left is shown the disposition of
your own bid or offer request if you made one. "winner" means you had the best (or equal best)
bid or offer, and now hold the current bid or offer. "bettered" means that someone else had a
better bid or offer. "lost.tie" means that you had an equal best bid or offer, but lost the resulting
random tie-break.,

The fifth line shows the result of the buy-sell step. If a trade occurs it is shown by a pair of <’s for
a buy or a pair of >'s for a sell. The price is shown under the current bid or offer that it derived
from.. On the left is shown any profit that you made, or "no trade" if no trade occurred, or blank if
a trade occurred in which you were not involved. "lost draw" means that you lost a random tie
break involving other buyers or sellers (the same as you) who also made buy or sell requests.

In either the bid-offer or the buy-sell line the left column can also show **illegal** or **]ate**,
**illegal** means that the your response was illegal, such as a bid below the current bid, or a
request to buy when there was no current offer. **late** means that you missed responding to
one or more steps, so the actual response was to a previous step and was ignored. Note that if this
occurs, subsequent information about the number of tokens traded (a, b, etc), and some summary
information, may be incorrect because relevant information was missed. See the description of the
variables in the skeleton programs for a more detailed discussion.

Double Auction Tournament -46- Participant's Manual
SUMMARIES

At the end of each period a short summary appears:
You made 3 trades, making a total profit of 286 in this period
Summary of trade prices (* = yours):
538* 545 521* 535 513* 509

The number of trades and the profit are just for the period that just ended.

At the end of each round the number of trades and profit is summarized for the current player for
each period of the round. For example:

End of round 1 ==== ===
Summary: period trades profit
1 . 286
2 3 293
total 6 579

At the end of the whole game a final summary appears too:

End of game 1760

Total profit: 1186
Efficiency: 109%

The total profit is the total reported by the monitor. If that differs from the amount computed by
adding up the individual profits for each round, the message will look like:

Total profit: 1186 (1037 accounted for)
This can occur if the player was **late** and missed a transaction.
The ‘Efficiency’ is the performance figure of merit reported by the monitor; the ratio of actual profit
to that expected if all trades occurred at the theoretical equilibrium price. Higher values represent
better performance.
5.3 Prompts and Responses in the Human Player
The previous section describes the display output of the human player besides the prompts and
responses. Normally the human player asks for your decision once in each bid-offer and buy-sell
step.
There are two types of prompts:

1. Prompts ending in a? expect a substantive reply, either a number or a 'y' for yes or 'n’ for
no.

2. Prompts ending in a > are merely informational, and expect only a carriage return in
response.

Ateither of these types of prompt, various options or commands can be specified instead of the
expected response. The prompt is then repeated.

Double Auction Tournament -47- Participant's Manual
BID-OFFER PROMPTS
In a bid-offer step the usual prompts are:

bid [n]? for a buyer
or offer [n]? for a seller

These invite you to type in a bid or offer value respectively. If you don't want to make a bid or
offer you can type an n (none), or just press return. The ‘[n]' reminds you that the default action is
‘none’.

Instead of one of the above prompts you may receive one of the informational prompts:

nothing to trade if you've traded all your tokens
or unwise to bid if the current bid is above your next token
or unwise to offer if the current offer is below your next token

The last two ‘unwise’ messages only appear if you set the 'u' option discussed below.
BUY-SELL PROMPTS
In a buy-sell step the usual ? prompts are:

buy at xxx [n]? for a buyer
or sell at xxx [n]? for a seller

Here xxx is the current offer or current bid price respectively. Your response should be y for yes
orn for no. The default if you just press return is shown in square brackets (n for no in the
example, but this can be reversed with the ‘a’ option).

Instead of one of the above prompts you may receive one of the followin g informational prompts:

not bidder> for a buyer not holding the current bid
or not offerer> fora seller not holding the current offer
or nothing to buy> for a buyer when there's no current offer
or nothing to sell> for a seller when there's no current bid
or nothing to trade> if you've traded all your tokens
or unwise to buy> for a buyer who'd make a loss by buying
or unwise to sell> for a seller who'd make a loss by selling

The last two ‘unwise’ messages only appear if you set the ‘u' option discussed below.

OPTIONS AND COMMANDS

At any prompt you may set or reset any of the following options. To set them simply type their
letter. To reset them type a - and then their letter. Options can be concatenated, and a - applies to
all subsequent options. For example, u-aw would set u and reset a and w.

u __—prevent ‘unwise’ choices likely to lead to a loss. This enables the ‘unwise to ...' prompts
detailed above, and refuses to accept any bid or offer that would result in a loss if accepted.

a accept bids or offers by default on the buy-sell step. This makes y (yes) the default for the
‘buy at ...' and ‘sell at ...' prompts.

Double Auction Tournament -48- Participant's Manual :

id
mn

P

fast. Removes the wait for a carriage return (or timeout) at all '>' prompts. The message is
shown without the '>', but no response is needed or allowed. Note that this may lead to
rapid scrolling of the game on the screen, and does not let you enter further options or
commands until a ? prompt next occurs,

wait. This turns off the automatic timeout and waits for ever for your response. On most
systems the human player types one '.' every second (or a ':' in the last five seconds) and

then defaults your response (as if you had just pressed return) after a certain time. If you turn

this off with the w option you may exceed the time that the monitor allows for your response,
which may lead to a **late** disposition or even to you being ‘killed’.

Pass. This causes every prompt (both ? and > types) to be defaulted for the rest of this
period. Note that P is upper-case.

The P option is reset at the start of each period but the other options are not.

Besides the above options which may be toggled on or off, the following commands may be given
to any prompt: |

quit Quits the game, which then continues without you.

help Prints a summary of these options and commands.

?

t

$.

h

Tells you what you can do in response to the current prompt.
Shows your token values and the current bid and offer values.
Shows the transaction prices so far in this period.

Shows a ‘history’ summary of the last few steps. The output is described in more detail
below.

5.4 History Display in the Human Player

The human player can display a compact summary of the previous N steps in the current period,
where N is a compile-time option. Use ‘h' in response to any prompt to obtain the history display.
The output combines each bid-offer and buy-sell step into a single line. For example:

t YOU B2 Si 82 price
1 400* 321 514 510*
2 435*> 433 476*> ATT] 435

Double Auction Tournament -49- Participant's Manual
The leftmost column shows the time t. This may be shown as a ? if unknown because of a ‘late’
condition. The time column may be followed by a |, calling attention to the fact that some steps
were missed, or a *, meaning that the information on this line is incomplete. Late responses can
cause either of these conditions, but * is also normal on the last line if only the bid-offer step has
occurred so far.

The columns for each player show the bid or offer values, followed by a * marking the current bid
or offer, and a < for a buy or a > fora sell. The actual transaction price is repeated in the last
column, A # is used instead of a * for a current bid or offer that was carried. forward from a
previous bid-offer step.

CHAPTER 6: DANI

This chapter explains how to use the Double Auction Network Interface (DANI), and how to
interpret its output. Compilation instructions are not given here; see the README file in DANI's
source directory.

6.1 Communication Methods

DANI acts as an interface between a monitor on the internet—normally the Santa Fe Token
Exchange (SFTE)—and a local player. DANI communicates with the monitor via sockets over the
internet, and with the player program by one of the following methods: -

pipe-based DANI starts up the player program once (as a child process) and attaches pipes
between it and the player's stdin and stdout.

arg-based This is just like pipe-based except that the pipes are attached to special descriptors
specified as arguments on the player's command line instead of using stdin and
stdout. For C players only. Useful for players that need to use stdin and stdout
themselves.

file-based DANI starts up the player program for each step of the game, reading and writing
files for communication.

user-based | DANI does not start up the player itself, but reads and writes messages to the player
on its stdin and stdout. Used for players on remote machines (e.g., dial-up lines)
that can talk to DANI directly.

There is considerable overlap between this chapter and chapter 5, because DANI's display and

-startup messages are similar to those of the internet- based C players.

6.2 Starting DANI

Before starting DANI (except to inquire about the current status at the SFTE), you must compile
and link your player program as well as DANT itself. Then start DANI with a command of the
form:

dani [options] [playername] [hostname]
The options are explained below. The other parameters are:

playername the name of the player program to be started. This must be in the current working
directory (though DANI needn't be). 'playername' cannot be specified if you use
the -u option, Otherwise if you omit it, DANI just inquires about the current status
at the Santa Fe Token Exchange or elsewhere.

hostname the name of the host to connect to on the internet. This only works if you have the
full networking software, which is not normally distributed. Otherwise the host is
taken as sfi.santafe. edu, for the SFTE. ‘hostname’ must be the second
argument (after playername) unless the -u option is used. See also the -h option

elow.

Double Auction Tournament -51- Participant's Manual
OPTIONS
-b

-S

Insist on being a buyer.

Insist on being a seller.

If neither -b-nor -s is specified the monitor will assign your role as buyer or seller.

Use pipe-based communication.
Use arg-based communication.
Use file-based communication.

Use user-based communication. This inhibits display or log output unless
redirected with -o.

If none of -p, -a, -f, or -u is specified the. default depends on a choice made when dani was

compiled.

-h name

-h hostname

-d

“q

Specifies the name of the player. If this is not supplied DANI will ask for it with
"Enter your name:."

An alternative way of spécifying a hostname if you have the full networking
software. oe

Turns on display of the game as it progresses.

Turns off display of the game (‘quiet’).

If neither -d nor -q is specified the default depends on a choice made when dani was compiled.

-o output

-k

Sends the display or log output to file ‘output’. Defaults to stdout. Redirection
with > may also be used, but -o may be useful if the player program also

produces stdout output (in which case you must use -a or -f). -o MUST be used if _

you want to produce display or log output with user-based (-u) communication.

Log messages. For debugging only. Implies -q. Messages generated by DANI
itself are prefixed by a *.

Don't send KILLED messages to player. For debugging in the filebased case—to

' prevent the player deleting its files.

After starting and testing the player, DANI will ask for your name (maximum 30 characters) unless
you already specified with the -n option, or are only inquiring about the status (no playername
given). Then, if it successfully connects to the monitor, you will then receive one of four types of
message from the monitor:

1. A description of the game schedule in a box of *'s, followed by the time at the monitor's
location. This means that no game is presently starting; try again at the appropriate time.

2. A "Waiting for..." message. This means that a game will start as soon as the condition is
satisfied. Further waiting messages will be sent every 30 seconds until the game starts or is
abandoned.

Double Auction Tournament -§2- Participant's Manual
om :

3. A "Game starting" message. This means that your connection satisfied the condition for a
game, which is now starting.

4. A "Sorry, ..." message. This means that a game is about to start, but that you cannot join it
for the reason given.

Note that all messages before the beginning of the game itself are sent to stderr, not stdout or the -o
file.

6.3 VAX/VMS Notes

DANI should work correctly on a VAX/VMS system as long as the Wollongong WIN/TCP
networking software is available. The treatment of file-based players is straightforward and should
cause no problem, but may be very slow on a busy system. Pipe-based players are much more
efficient, and thus faster, but more fragile. The player is started up as a sub-process of DANI, and
communicates with it via VMS "mailboxes." If something goes wrong it is possible for the player
subprocess to continue running (in a wait state) even after DANI exits or aborts. You can check
for subprocesses with the command "SHOW PROCESS/SUB"—the player sub-process is always

called PLAYER. If you see PLAYER in the process tree, you can kill it with "STOP PLAYER.”
DANI will refuse to run again if PLAYER already exists.

Note that you must have the TMPMBX and. NETMBX process privileges, and a non-zero
subprocess quota, to run DANI. Most users will have these.

Be patient when starting up DANI. VaX/V MS takes a relatively long time to start up a subprocess
when the system is busy.

6.4 Explanation of DANI's display output -

DANT is able to display the progress of a game as it interfaces between the monitor and a player.
This is enabled by the -d option and disabled by the -q option; it may or may not be the default, as
fixed before compilation.

DANI 's display output consists of initial headings, the main game, and various summaries. The
initial headings and summaries are identical to those of the internet-based C players, but the main
game display is different.

INITIAL HEADINGS

The first part of the output gives basic game parameters and a list of player numbers. For example:

DA game 1760 Tue Jun 6 21:32:20 1989

nrounds: 2 nperiods: 2 ntimes: 50 price range: 1-1000
2 buyers: Bl 501 B2 9999
2 sellers: Sl 502 $2 0

You are seller $1, otherwise known as YOU

The parameters and game-id (1760 in the example) should be self-explanatory, Note that the date
and time is local to DANT's location, which may be in a different time-zone than the monitor itself.

Double Auction Tournament -53- Participant's Manual
The lists of buyers and sellers give their player numbers, or 0 if unknown or anonymous. These

numbers may be useful in identifying strategies you have and have not played against. 9999 is _

used for a human player.
MAIN GAME

Each period of a game consists of headings and then one line for each bid-offer and each buy-sell
step. For example:

wannnee ‘round 1 --------------- period 1 ------------------ tokens: 323 457 506 537

Co Ea A i SS SO SS 2

oo ----end of period 1 of round 1----- -

The heading line shows the round and period number, and the assigned token values. Note that
these token values are usually scrolled off the screen as the game progresses, and may be worth
writing down,

Bid-offer steps are labeled on the left with the time; buy-sell steps are unnumbered. A vertical bar
(|) always appears between the buyers and the sellers, and a period (.) appears in the column for
the current player ("YOU") in each buy-sell step; these are useful after the headings have scrolled
off the screen.

Each bid and offer is shown in a bid-offer step, with asterisks (*) marking the current bid and
offer. If there is no new bid, but a previous current bid is still outstanding, it is shown in the
bidder's column with a # instead of a *, and similarly for offers.

To the left of the bids in a bid-offer step is shown the disposition of the current player's
bid/offer/none request. ‘winner’ means that the bid or offer was the best (or equal best) and thus
became the current bid or offer. ‘bettered’ means that a better bid or offer was received. ‘lost tie’
means that the bid or offer was equal best, but the current player lost the resulting random tie-
break,

a)

In a buy-sell step a transaction is shown by a pair of <'s for a buy, or a pair of >'s for a sell. The
token traded for each player is shown by an upper-case letter (A = first, B = second, etc.). The

transaction price is given in the rightmost column. This price column is omitted if there are the
maximum number of players; the price is easily deduced from the preceding current bid or offer.

To the left of the transaction information in a buy-sell step is shown the disposition of the current
player's buy/sell/none request. 'yes' means that a buy or sell request was made and carried out.
‘(yes)’ means that a buy or sell request was made, but was not accepted because another player
also made a valid request and won the random tie-break. This is usually better than 'yes' if you are
the current bidder or offerer, because the trade occurs at YOUR price. ‘no’ means that a buy or
sell request was permitted but was not made. The space is left blank if no buy or sell request was

permitted.

If any profit was made it is shown in the profit column in the appropriate buy-sell step. Note that
this can occur with a disposition of ‘yes’, ‘(yes)’, 'no’, and even blank.

The dispositions '**bad**" and "**late**' can appear in either step. "kbad**' means that the
current player's response was illegal, such as a bid below the current bid, or arequest to buy when
there was no current offer. '**late**' means that the player missed responding to one or more
steps, so the actual response was to a previous step and was ignored. Note that if this occurs,
subsequent jnformation about the token number traded (A, B, etc), and summary information

described below, may be incorrect because relevant information was missed. See the description
of the variables in the skeleton programs for a more detailed discussion.

SUMMARIES

At the end of each period a short summary appears.
You made 3 trades, making a total profit of 286 in this period
Summary of trade prices (* = yours):
539% 545 521* 535 513* 509

The number of trades and the profit are just for the period that just ended.

At the end of each round the number of trades and profit is summarized for the current player for
each period of the round. For example:

====== End of round I = =

Summary: period trades profit
1 3 286
2 3 293

total 6 579

At the end of the whole game a final summary appears too:

End of game 1760
Total profit: 1186
Efficiency: 109%

The total profit is the total reported by the monitor. If that differs from the amount computed by
adding up the individual profits for each round, the message will look like:

Total profit: 1186 (1037 accounted for)

Double Auction Tournament - -55- Participant's Manual

CHAPTER 7: TOURNAMENT RULES AND REGISTRATION

This chapter specifies the rules, parameter settings and entry procedures for the actual Double
Auction tournament to be held in March 1990. The rules of the Double Auction itself are given in
the Introduction chapter; this specifies the rules relating to tournament entries and the distribution
of the $10,000 prize money. The structure of the tournament is also discussed. An entry form
appears at the end of the chapter.

7.1 Tournament Rules

1.

The deadline for entries is March 1, 1990. Entries must be received at the Santa Fe Institute
by 5 PM (MST) on this date to be eligible for inclusion in the tournament. If an entry
conforms to all the rules listed below it will be accepted as a PLAYER in the DA tournament.
If an entry has been submitted before the deadline and is found to violate one of the rules
listed below, it will be returned to the entrant for revision and conditional acceptance
provided the revised strategy is received before the deadline. Entrants will have at most one
chance. to submit strategies that conform to the rules. In the sequel we will refer to an
accepted computer program (source and associated materials as described below) as a
"player," and "entrant" as the human(s) who submitted it.

A maximum of 100 players will be accepted. Of these, 70 will be accepted on a first-come,
first-served basis starting on September 1, 1989 until the entry deadline of March 1, 1990.
The remaining 30 slots have been reserved for selection by the tournament organizers to
guarantee sufficient diversity in the types of strategies submitted. If the organizers do not use
all 30 slots, those that remain will be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis as described
above. A list of current entrants’ names and E-mail addresses is available by ftp in the
"entries" file, or by request from the organizers. Entrants who wish to remain anonymous
throughout the tournament can have their names appear as "anonymous" in the entries file.

A valid entry consists of |

A. source code for the user routines in one of the skeleton programs, subject to additional
restrictions listed below, and.

B. a $10.00 entry fee payable to Santa Fe Institute, and

C. oa signed, completed registration form (at the end of this chapter). .

The user routines referred to in 3A are the 4 Strategy Routines and 8 optional Miscellaneous
Routines listed in the "skeleton" chapter of the documentation. They must be accompanied
by appropriate declarations and/or definitions of the variables and parameters, as required by
the language used.

The routines must be written in C, Fortran or Pascal and must be compatible with the
skeleton programs as provided in these languages.

As an alternative to 3A, 4, and 5, users may submit source for a complete self-contained
player program. This must: ;

A. Conform to the message-passing protocol described in the "messages" chapter of the
documentation.

Double Auction Tournament -57- Participant's Manual
10.

11.

12.

B. Be able to communicate using the PIPEBASED method with the monitor on a Sun-4
system; this mainly requires that messages be read from stdin and written to stdout.

C. Be supplied in source form in C, Fortran, or Pascal. Other languages may be
considered, but only by prior arrangement with the organizers.

All players must be sufficiently documented by comments in the source, and optionally by
additional written (or ascii text) materials. The documentation should include at least the
following:

A. The name, affiliation, and address of each author. These MUST appear in comments in
the source, as well as on the entry form.

A general intuitive description of what the strategy does.
Definition of all significant variables and parameters. .

References to any specific algorithms or numerical methods used.

ao oO

Description of the content and use of any external files needed or created by the
program. _

F. Notes on any special requirements for compiling, linking, or running the program.

We reserve the right to reject programs which we deem to be poorly documented or
unnecessarily obscure. In such cases the authors will be invited to make improvements
within a reasonable time before any final rejection: : ,

Participants’ programs may create and use external files, which will be preserved from game
to game. Each player program will have its own directory, and may only access files within
that directory. Additional files may be submitted with a tournament entry, but must be
adequately documented.

Players must be runnable on a Sun-4 running SunOS 4.0. This means especially that only
commonly available library routines should be used. Players will be checked for runnability
upon receipt, and the organizers will make reasonable efforts to make any minor alterations
necessary to suit local conditions. Ultimately however, we reserve the right to réject
programs that we cannot run. Authors should contact the organizers if in doubt about the
availability of library routines or language features at Santa Fe.

There are no explicit CPU time, memory, or disk storage limits for player programs.
However if a program is found to use greatly excessive amounts of any of the above
resources (relative to what is used by othér players), the organizers reserve the right to
request the entrant to modify the program so that its requirements are more in line with other
players or, as a last resort, to disqualify the program. ,

Submitted players cannot be withdrawn or revised once submitted, except to satisfy the
requirements these rules. Major changes in the player program will be prohibited once
submitted.

Although joint entries are permissible, at most one player will be allowed per entrant.
Duplicate or plagiarized player programs will be disqualified; all submissions must be
distinct.

Players are only allowed to use information
A. explicitly passed to them by the monitor, or
B. _ stored in their private files (optional).

Different players may not communicate directly, and may not share files. Any attempt to
violate these rules (in letter or spirit) will be grounds for disqualification.

Both tournament entrants and non-entrants may use the Santa Fe Token Exchange (SFTE)
for practice games if their hardware and software permits it. No guarantee of availability on a
particular system or at a particular time is made. Traders on the SFTE may be either human
or robot traders. There will be no cash profits paid for trading on the SFTE, and the
tournament will be run independently of the outcome of any SFTE games.

Traders playing as local (non-network) players on the SFTE will be selected from those
developed at SFI. Different selections may be made at different times of day. Participants
are invited to submit their programs for this purpose, though no guarantee of using them is
made. The organizers guarantee the confidentiality of programs submitted for local SFTE use
(by using only the binary executable version of the program in an inaccessable file),

Prize money totaling approximately $10,000 will be paid to participating entrants in
proportion to the total trading profits earned by their player programs in all tournament games
in which they play (see description of parameter settin gs below).

In order to encourage entrants to develop trading strategies that perform well in a wide variety
of environments, the parameter settings in the Double Auction tournament games will be
systematically altered. In the tournament games the base token values (see the ‘game' file)
will normally be set to zero, so the relevant parameters consist of the following 10 variables
(for more detailed definitions, see chapters 1 and 3, and ‘game’ file):

NTOKENS number of tokens assigned to each trader
NBUYERS number of buyers
NSELLERS number of sellers

NROUNDS number of rounds in DA game
NPERIODS number of periods per round

NTIMES number of bid/offer and buy/sell-steps per period
RANI uniform random token generator upper bound 1
RAN2 uniform random token generator upper bound 2
RAN3 uniform random token generator upper bound 3
RAN4 uniform random token generator upper bound 4

The meanings of RAN], ..., RAN4 are discussed in detail in rule 25 below.

Games in the Double Auction Tournament will be selected from a fixed number of
environments, E(i), i=1,...,1. Each environment EQ) is a complete specification of the 10
DA game parameters listed in 17. All the above parameters are passed to each player
program at the start of each DA game (except that RAN1-4 and the token generation method
may be withheld in a few environments). This guarantees that players have common
knowledge about the environment, a game-theoretic consideration.

The specific environments used will be chosen by the organizers in advance of the actual
tournament, guided in part by scientific objectives and in part by a desire to give all entrants
an equal opportunity to do well in the tournament. However information on I and EQ) will

Double Auction Tournament -59- Participant's Manual
20,

21,

22.

23.

24.

not be released to entrants before the tournament, to discourage them from "tuning" their
programs to specific environments.

For each environment E(j), a total of NG) DA games will be played, distributing a share A(i)
of the $10,000 prize money with

A(i)+ ... tAC) =-$10000.

The number of games N(j) will be chosen sufficiently large to average out variations in
profits due to random choices of player matchings, token values, and tie-breaking rules.

In each of the N(i) DA games in environment E(i), entrants’ programs will be randomly
chosen- without replacement- from the pool of valid players for inclusion in the current DA
game. If a player program is drawn that cannot fill the position (e.g., if the entrant only
wrote a "buyer" program but was selected to play the role of seller") the the program is
withdrawn from the pool and another player is picked. Players which have already been
selected are also withdrawn from the pool.

Draws will continue in this way until the requisite number of buyer and seller programs are
selected to play in the current DA game. This implies in particular that no program will play
more than once in a single DA game.

If TP(i,j) is the total token profit earned by a player j in the subset of the NG) games in
environment E(i) in which it participated, then the actual dollar payment for that environment,
DP(i,j), is given by:

DP(i,j) = cG@)TPG,))

where c(i) is the conversion ratio between token profits and dollar profits. The total dollar
payment to entrant j in the entire tournament is then simply the sum over each of the I
environments, DP(1,j) + .... + DP(L,j).

The conversion ratio c(i) between token profits and actual dollar payments will be set in each
environment E(i) to satisfy the following equation:

AG) =c@)TSG)

Here TS(i) is the total surplus of the N(@i) games in environment E(i). In a single game the
surplus is geometrically the area between the implied supply and demand curves, to the left of
the point where they intersect, and would be the total profit if all trading occurred at the
theoretical competitive equilibrium price. TS(@) will be calculated by summing this surplus
over the N(i) games in environment E(i).

Since the conversion ratios c(i) will thus be determined a priori, the total dollar payment to
participants may not be exactly $10,000, but is expected to be within a few percent of that
figure.

Trading programs have the right of refusal. Thus, entrants do not have to write strategies to
play in all possible environments. For example an entrant may submit a program that only
plays the role of buyer. Of course, since the expected profit in any given game is positive, an
entrant's tournament earnings will be reduced in proportion to the fraction of games in which
their program is unable to play.

Double. Auction Tournament -60- Participant's Manual

25. Token values are represented by TG,k,l), where j indexes the player, k indexes the token
number, and 1 indexes whether the player is a buyer or a seller. Tokens will normally be
randomly generated according to

TG,k) =A + Bd) + C(k,) + DG,k,D
where

A =U[0,RAN1],

Bd) = U[0,RAN2],
C(k,l) = U[0,RAN3],
DG,k,]) = U[0,RAN4].

Here U[0,R] denotes a uniform random variable on the interval [0,R]. Random variables A,
B(1), C(k,l), and D(j,k,l) are drawn independently of each other and independently for
distinct indices (j,k,l).

RANI, ..., RAN4 are passed to the trading strategy using the 'gametype’ variable; see
definition of 'gametype’ in section 3.2 "Public Constants" of chapter 3. Note that due to
technicalities of the software design, no token value is allowed to exceed 8000. This implies
that for very large settings for RAN(i), i=1,...,4 the actual distribution is truncated. In the
tournament we will not choose any values for RANG) i=1,...,4 that yield truncated

distributions.

In a few environments, representing not more than 33% of the total available profit, the
tokens may be generated by another method not revealed to the players. This will be
indicated by gametype = 0. : :

26. The organizers expect entrants to obey the spirit as well as the letter of the above rules to
produce strategies that exhibit "reasonable trading behavior.” In the event that certain
‘Strategies are found to behave in a grossly unreasonable way (e.g., purely random
‘strategies, or ones designed to maximize losses) or in a way that has not been explicitly
covered in the above rules, the organizers reserve the right to exclude the deviant strategies
after giving the entrant an opportunity to revise the strategy to produce more reasonable
behavior,

CHAPTER 8: THE MESSAGE-PASSING PROTOCOL

This chapter gives technical details of the message-passing protocol which is used for
communication between the player programs and the monitor program. It is not needed by
participants who base their programs on a skeleton program.

8.1 Messages and message packets

The tournament involves a central monitor program and a number of competing player programs.
The player programs communicate only with the monitor, not directly with each other. All
communication is performed by sending and receiving simple messages.

A message consist of a single line containing a sequence of integers. Each integer is right justified
in a 5-column field, blank filled on the left. A typical message might be

14..350...-1

where each . represents a space. All integers lie in the range -999 to 9999 to leave at least one
blank between columns.

The first integer in each message indicates the message type. Here we name such message types
according to the code table in Section 8.6. Thus a typical message is written:

OFFER offer-price  offerer

The capitalized name OFFER stands for the unique integer code for this message type (16 from
Section 8.6), whereas the lower-case names 'offer-price’ and ‘offerer’ stand for parameter values
that are conveyed by the message.

Each communication from a player program to the monitor consists of a single message with one
parameter (i.e. two integers in all). In some cases the parameter is unused and is setto0. |

Most communications from the monitor to a player program consist of several messages called a
message packet. The individual messages all have 2 parameters (i.e. 3 integers in all). In some
cases the second parameter is unused and is set to 0.

In the networked version of the game, in which the monitor and player programs may be on
different machines, there are some initial pre-game messages exchanged before the main game
begins. These pre-game messages are not purely numeric and do not obey the above conventions.
They are described in Section 8.4.

Double Auction Tournament -63- Participant's Manual

End End-of-game

i, j, and k show the number of times each group is repeated:
i= ntimes
j= nperiods
k = nrounds

The center and right columns show the message packets and messages in each step, reading down
the page in order. The game may be divided into 6 types of steps, as shown in the left column.
Each game has one initialization step and one end step. Between these there are 'nrounds' rounds,
each consisting of one round step and then 'nperiods' periods. Each period consists of one period
step and then ‘ntimes' alternating bid-offer and buy-sell steps. These steps are described in detail
in the remaining sections of this document. Appendix B provides a summary of all steps and their
messages.

The center column shows the message packets sent by the monitor to the player programs. These
may be either single or multiple messages, as detailed below.

The right-hand column shows the messages sent by the player programs to the monitor. The

messages shown are alternatives. In a bid-offer step, for example, each player program is
expected to send either a BID message or an OFFER message or a NONE message.

8.3 Individual Steps of a DA game

Initialization step

The initialization step occurs once at the start of a game. It consists of:

1. An initialization-1 packet from the monitor that provides the general parameters for the game;

2. Aresponse from the player program that either agrees to play (ACCEPT) or drops out at this
stage (REJECT); .

3. An initialization-2 packet from the monitor that provides more specific information about the
game and gives parameters particular to each player;

4. AREADY response from the player program when it is ready to play.

INITIALIZATION-1 PACKET

The first initialization packet gives general information about the game. The following messages
will be sent in order:

TYPE . protocol monitor
GAME game-type game-id
LENGTH nrounds 0
LENGTH nperiods ntimes
‘TOKENS max-tokens 0
NUMBER max-buyers max-sellers
ROLE role timeout

The variables have the following meanings:

protocol

monitor -

game-type

game-id

nrounds
nperiods

ntimes

Specifies the version of the message-passing protocol being followed. This should
match that of the player programs. protocol = 5 for the version described in this
document.

Specifies the version of the monitor in use. This can be ignored by participants.

Used to identify different types of games that will be played, conveying the values
of the token-generation random number parameters. See the gametype variable in
chapter 3 of the documentation for details.

Provides a unique identification for this particular game. game-id will be increased
for each game played.

Specifies the maximum number of rounds in the game. Maximum 20.
Specifies the maximum number of periods in each round. Maximum 5.

Specifies the maximum number of time steps in each period. In each time step there
is first a bid-offer step and then a buy-sell step. A period will never be terminated
early (before ntimes time steps have been played) unless no bids, offers, buys, or
sells are occurring, and no mutually profitable trades could be made. Termination
will no necessarily occur in such a case. Maximum 400.

Double Auction Tournament -65- Participant's Manual
max-tokens Specifies the maximum number of tokens that any player will be allotted in any
round of this game. Maximum 8. A maximum of 4 will be used in the tournament.

max-buyers Specifies the maximum number of buyers in this game; the actual number (given in
the initialization-2 packet) may be less because some players may drop out after this
step. Maximum 20.

max-sellers Specifies the maximum number of sellers in this game; the actual number (given in
the initialization-2 packet) may be less because some players may drop out after this
step. Maximum 20..

role Takes one of two values, and should match the type of player program it is sent to:
1 For a buyer.
2 For a seller,

timeout Specifies the conditions under which the monitor will timeout a player in any step:
0 Timeout occurs after a short time, which may vary from step to step.

Governed by the timefactors in the monitor's game file.

9999 No timeout because the player was given the -w flag in the monitor's player
file. The monitor will wait indefinitely for the player. other Approximate
number of seconds until timeout. This is the timeout value from the
monitor's game file. When a player is timed out in a bid-offer or buy-sell
step it is given a “late (-2) status when it next does respond. The player is
terminated if it times out in any other step, or is not respondin g at the end of
a period.

FIRST RESPONSE MESSAGE
The player program must respond to the initialization-1 packet with one of the followin g messa ges:

ACCEPT player-number
or REFUSE reason

In the first case the player program agrees to play the game, and should not drop out at any future
Stage. In the second case the program refuses to play and gives a reason; it should then exit
immediately.

player-number Identifies the particular player program. Should be unique for each player.
Use the value assigned to you, or 0 if a correct value is unknown. 9999 js
normally used for a human player.

reason A reason for refusing to play. Possible values are:
1 protocol is unacceptable.
2 game-type is unacceptable.
4 nrounds is unacceptable.
8 nperiods is unacceptable.

16 ntimes is unacceptable,

32 max-tokens is unacceptable.

64 max-buyers or max-sellers is unacceptable.

efficiency The ratio of ‘profit' to the profit predicted by economic theory, times 100. This is a
measure of how well the player performed, with 100 being "average" and higher
values being better.

The player program should terminate itself upon receiving this message.

Double Auction Tournament -74- Participant's Manual
Tis,

8.4 Special Messages
QUIT messages

At any stage where an ordinary message is expected, the player program may send the monitor the
message:

QUIT type

The monitor will then drop that player from the game. ‘type' should be zero for an intentional
abandonment of the game (normally used only for a human player), or non-zero if an unexpected
fatal error occurred in the player program. The monitor will report "quit" for the first case, and
"fatal error" for the second. The player program itself should print an appropriate error message
(to stderr if UNIX).

KILLED messages .
The monitor (or DANI) may at any time send a player the message:
KILLED reason. . 0

The player program should print an error message (to stderr if UNIX) if desired and then exit
immediately. The reason parameter is a code saying why the monitor killed the player:

Killed by the operator running the monitor.

The player was not responding at the end of a period. A temporary lack of response is
allowed within a period (and gives status = -2), but is fatal at the end of a period.

The player sent a message with a message type that was either illegal in the current context,
or entirely unknown (notin Appendix C).

The player sent an undecodable message (not 2 inte gers).

The monitor couldn't find or couldn't read the .out message file which should have been
written by the player (file-based communication only),

The monitor couldn't read a message from the player because of an I/O failure (pipe-based
or inet-based communication only).

The monitor encountered an error, probably because the game wasn 't properly defined.
The game was abandoned, probably because there weren't enough players.

Killed by DANI due to a communications problem or inconsistency.

10. Another reason—treserved for possible future use,

No error—silent kill; used by DANT if there isn't actually a game in progress.

SV ON DN WR ! Ne

TEST messages

TEST messages are used by the monitor or by DANI to check that a player is functioning properly.
At any time the monitor or dani may send the message:

TEST k 0
and the player should respond with:
TEST k

The variable k is an arbitrary integer, which must be echoed correctly in the player's reply.

Double Auction Tournament -75- Participant's Manual
Pre-game messages

In the networked version of the game, in which the monitor and player programs may be on
different machines, there are some initial pre-game messages exchanged before the main game
begins. They apply equally whether the player is actually an interface to a human player, or is a
machine player. Fhey are as follows:

1. FROM PLAYER TO MONITOR

The player program must initiate the dialogue with:

DA role type userid
name

Note that 'DA' means the literal upper-case characters DA, not a numeric code.

tole Specifies the roles that the player is willing to play: 1 for a buyer, 2 for a seller, 3
for either, 0 for inquiry only.

type Specifies the type of player: 1 for a human player directly connected, 2 for a
machine player directly connected, 3 for any player connected via DANI.

userid The program's userid on the player's local machine. Up to 8 characters.

name The player's or player program's name, up to 30 characters before the newline.

2. FROM MONITOR TO PLAYER

The monitor responds with one or more textual messages, which should normally be printed or
displayed by the player, followed by one of the following: either by

start
nogame
abort

‘start' signifies that the main game (starting with the initialization-1 packet) is about to begin.
‘nogame'’ indicates that there is no current game in which to participate. ‘abort' signifies that,
although a game was expected to begin, either the whole game has been aborted or the player is not
eligible to play in it. The reason for an ‘abort' message will be given in the preceding textual
messages. The player program should exit after receiving a 'nogame' or ‘abort’ message.
